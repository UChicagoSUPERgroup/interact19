The metal pieces are worn and rusty from being outside so long.",Yes,The boat shows signs of rust and wears from being exposed to the elements. There was once a large body of water there but over time its disappeared.,Yes,The picture is in black and white because its from a time before color film. There are age markings on the photograph itself that would show wear.,No,It looks like a modern hotel room. Theres no time difference.,Yes,It shows the progression of cell phones across the years and the changes in their designs,Agree,"I followed the examples given at the start, but most of the images were pretty clear in how they could represent ""old"".",Agree,I described how old was represented and in a way basic enough to understand easily.,"it would need to be able to tell when something is old or just seems old. The hotel room was modern, but 70s modern.",,3,Yes,"Both the watch and the background look old. The paint on the metal surface is peeling and the surface itself is bent and somewhat rusted, suggesting age. The watch seems to be an antique and looks somewhat battered. I",Yes,The boat depicted in the photo looks old and decrepit. Evidence of decay is a clue suggesting whether something is old.,Yes,"Old means aged. This is an old photo: it is black and white, and appears to be taken some time ago. And at least one man pictured could be classified as old.",No,Nothing in the image and in the room depicted in the image immediately suggests something old. THe room looks fairly new and the decor in the room looks newish too.,Yes,"These phones are old in the sense that they are outdated. tHey are early models of mobile phones. Their age (oldness) is measured relative to other phones. Old is not an absolute category, therefore, but a relative/comparative one.",Disagree,"Old is a slippery concept, and I don't think I really did an adequate job of providing rules for recognizing it.",Strongly Disagree,I imagine many examples of old things that would escape the minimal definitions I provided.,The concept of relative age is difficult. And how to recognize the old in non-organic things.,,4,Yes,"There are abrupt changes in color in this image. There are objects that have pieces missing, are cracked, and are chipped. This is a color image, but the abrupt changes in color are indicative of the concept of old.",Yes,"This image contains a boat which has several abrupt color changes. There are pieces that are disfigured and missing. Rust, an orange component of objects, is often an indication of old things.",Yes,Images that are black and white are often old. There is an old man in this picture. The man second from the left is old. You can tell because he has looser skin than the other men.,No,"This image does not contain old. There are no unexpected abrupt interruptions in color. None of the surfaces have missing pieces, cracks, or chips. The image is not black and white.",Yes,"Old objects often have abrupt changes in color on their surfaces. Old objects can have missing pieces, scratches, or cracks in them.",Neutral,Old is an abstract contract. It is MUCH more difficult to determine an algorithm to identify the intangible.,Strongly Disagree,The concept of old is difficult to convey. I had to hone in on specific situations that were dissimilar from picture to picture.,Plenty. Old is an adjective that can apply to so many different objects that I feel it is very difficult to encapsulate it all in a brief description.,,5,Yes,"This door, or piece of furniture, looks really old for all the dents, the missing paints, and the ""fixing"" it has.",Yes,"The boat looks old because the paint is ruined, there are dents and it looks rusted as well, so it must have been painted and then been used long time ago.",Yes,"From the style of the clothes, and from the color of the picture, it's easy to understand that this picture has been taken long time ago, maybe 50 or more years ago, and it can be considered relatively old.",No,"The style of the nightstand resembles a little one of those old radios, but this picture and its content don't show the concept of old.",Yes,"These phones are 10 and more years old, and even if this amount of time it's relatively short, if we think about the speed with which the technology evolves and get replaced, we can consider those cellular phone ""old"", almost ""prehistoric"".",Neutral,"I think I gave the computer may hints about what means to be ""old"", but this is a difficult concept, maybe it would have been necessary to use 50 pictures to explain it better rather than just 5.",Neutral,"The computer will be able to recognize old/ruined objects, but I don't know if it will be able to understand what is genuinely old and what it just looks old.","This concept was a lot harder than the others, I might have used the picture of a grandpa with his grandson or the picture of a Model A and one of a BMW Z4..",,6,Yes,The items in this image are rusted and falling apart. Paint is chipping from the wall. The wood is burnt. The clock is broken. All of these are things that happen over time. You don't tend to see damage like this in things that are not old.,Yes,"The boat in this image looks very old. The paint is faded and chipping. One side of the cabin is another color, as though it might be rusting. The wood has weathered, and is coming apart.",Yes,"This photo is sepia in tone, rather than in color, and it has faded a bit. It's not very clear. This tells me it is old. I can also tell it's old because the fashions and styles worn by the men in the picture are from many years ago.",No,Nothing in this image stands out as old. The items in the image all appear to be recent. There are no clear signs of wear.,No,"This image is in color. The items in the image are all representations of modern technology. The items are in good repair, uniform in color, unblemished in appearance. This is not an old photo, nor are the items in it old.",Agree,"We've covered the topic fairly thoroughly, with good examples.",Agree,Dating the photo and the items in it has been covered.,"The computer likely needs additional experience of its own with antiques, which often appear in great repair, but are very old.",,7,Yes,the rust and decay on the door and the broken clock parts. the peeling paint also,Yes,the boat is old an rusty and full of decay.,Yes,this photo is in balck and white and faded,No,the room is so modern. the lines are slick and very mismmal. it looks kind of retro but that future type of retro.,Yes,these phones are old in terms of tech they are from the late 90s and early 2000s and are soem of the first ones out.,Agree,i used soem common things people use to tell if something is old,Agree,i talked about decya and rust things that seem to olny happen to older things,i could not tell the pc about the differnt levels of old,,8,No,"This appears to be a recently made object on the door, combined in a way to make it look like it was inspired by old clockwork style. The shininess of the clock and design look recently made and the torch cutting and burns on the door look like it was done recently due to the soot and lack of oxidation on the exposed metal in the picture.",Yes,A boat is sitting in what looks like a dried lake bed. It may have sunk or been simply abandoned when the water levels dropped. The paint on the boat is worn and chipped and the boat appears to be rusted. Those signs suggest the boat was left out for many years and is old.,Yes,The fashion style of the man in a suit and soldiers is typical of the 1940s and 1950s. The graininess of the photo and spots on it make it appear to be old.,Yes,The room has retro furnishings. The style of the furniture looks to be inspired by 1960 designs. The round shape of the nightstand includes design elements of older designs. The lamps next to the bed also have an old design. The chair and frosted glass are styles more common from several decades ago.,Yes,"Several generations of phones are displayed from newest on the left to older models on the right. The design of phones have changed much over this period. A phone that is 20 years old, like the ones on the right side, were far more primitive and utilitarian for making phone calls only. New phones are much more capable and flexible devices.",Agree,"Understanding design concepts and inspirations will require much more information. For example, the clothes in one picture is a very high level concept. For the clock set in an iron piece, the inspiration for 18th or 19th century style designs requires knowing what it really looked like. Also, the cell phone picture depends on old in the relative sense: it's a span of 20 years and has undergone many iterations in that type, causing obsolescence. In other ways I think the descriptions I wrote helped. Recognizing whether an item is rusted or not, and how clean it looks outside could help determine if something is old. Also, grainy and spotted photos could be old too.",Disagree,"There are may ways an object can be considered to contain the concept old. Physical properties of weathering, wear and design could mean old, but there are other items that are old which lack one or more of those properties. Some modern items could have superficial similarities to old items, but could be completely new overall.","It would need a large body of knowledge on design of objects and how it has changed over time and understand how to recognize whether an item represents an example of its class of objects. Color pallets, surface reaction to wear, where items belong and what items are used for is needed to understand the context of the item in a photo.",,9,Unsure,Some parts of the display look old but they are put together in a way that indicates this is an art installation and not an actual scene. The clock part is old and the scorched wood and door might be old but the art might have been arranged very recently.,Yes,"The boat itself is beached and weathered, indicating age. The boat is wooden which is typical of old boats and the paint is chipped and fading all over, like happens in extreme age of boats.",Yes,The photo is in black and white and the style of clothing is old. Especially the width and length of the ties indicates that the photo is especially old. The hair styles are old and the vest that the man is wearing indicates age of the photo.,No,"The room is designed in a modern, new fashion. The lighting is bright with light woods and metal. Especially the opaque glass for the bathroom is a feature of very new and modern hotel rooms. The bedding is also new looking. No part of the photo conveys anything that looks old.",Yes,"Some phones are older styles, like the ones with complete keyboards or phone dial buttons only. The small phones are more likely than not to be old.",Agree,I pointed out specific features of the photos that indicate old features or new features(that negate old in the photo).,Agree,"The computer should be able to look for things in a photo that indicate new, like styles of furnishings or clothing or coloring that might show age.",It is difficult to tell whether the point is the PHOTO being old or something IN the photo being old. Those are different things. Like the art installation was probably new but some things in it were old.,,10,Yes,The paint is peeling the metal is rusted the wood is splintered,Yes,The paint is peeling. the wood is rotten. the boat is broken,Yes,The image is black and white/ the style of clothes is old,No,the style is modern. the furniture is new and undamaged. nothing broken peeling or rotten,No,there is no indication of wear or damage,Agree,I showed several things that indicate age,Neutral,I demonstraed some things that indicate newness,more examples of what is not old,,11,Yes,it is old and broken and rusty.,Unsure,"the boat is old, but this is unclear the focus is on the boat.",Unsure,"no I don't think so.it an old picture, cause it is black and white.",Unsure,This place looks great. It doesn't look old at all.,Unsure,the phone looks pretty beat up and dirty and out of date.,Strongly Disagree,it isn't clear what is old and what it isn't,Strongly Disagree,"I'm not even comfortable with it learning the five example, of course the future is definite.",what part of the image is old.,,12,Yes,"This is a photo of an object that is old. It is falling apart,paint is peeling, metal is rusting, and the wood is worn. These are all indications that this object is old.",Yes,"The painting is depicting an old boat.. the passage of time is indicated by the boat being stranded and abandoned in a dried-up lake. The wood and paint on the boat are weathered, which indicates that it has been there a long time. Also, there is dried algae on the side of the boat, which would have taken time to grow and dry up.",Yes,The photo itself is old. The picture is somewhat blurry and in black and white. These things indicate an older photograph. Also. the uniforms worn by the men are styled with button-pockets and cloth belts with brass clasps. These are styles popular many years ago.,No,"A the items in this photo are new, not old. The white items are very clean and bright, and they do not show any yellowing of age or wear. The lighting and glass are bright, which indicates little use. The woodwork is shiny and smooth, which again shows no age from wear.",Yes,Some of the cell phones in the photo are relatively old in comparison to the newer smartphones. The older cell phones have smaller screens and button keypads. The really old cell phones have external antennas.,Agree,"I gave the computer specific things to look for as indications that items are old. So, it should be able to identify weathered and worn items.",Agree,"The specific indicators that I listed are common to old items, so the computer should be able to isolate these traits and identify them.","Perhaps the condition of the image itself could be taken into account. If the paper, canvass, or other materials are faded, torn, or peeled, this would indicate an older image.",,13,Yes,The metal is rusted. That is one sign that something is old. The paint is also chipping away. It looks like it has been very well used over the time.,Yes,This boat looks old because its paint is eroding away. It looks like it has been used for a long time.,Yes,"The picture is in black and white, which could mean it is a very old picture since they didn't always have color pictures. The men in the picture are a bit old. They are not elderly, but they are older adults.",No,Everything in this room looks brand new. It is all clean. Everything is in its own space. There is nothing old in this picture.,Yes,"This picture contains phones from different makes and models. All these phones have been made at different times. The ones that have been around longer, would be the old ones.",Agree,"I think I covered some of the basics. Such as paint chipping away, and items looking like they have been used before.",Agree,"I think overall, a computer should be able to tell whether something is old or not. Some things may be tricky. Such as an antique that has been kept in very good condition.",The antiques that are kept in perfect shape is one thing. Something that could have a fresh coat of paint could fool the computer as well.,,14,No,"The photo is very crisp and clear and the colors are bright. This would seem to indicate a newer camera took the picture. There is peeling paint, but that's not an indicator of age by itself, and furthermore the paint doesn't seem faded at all.",Yes,"The boat in the foreground is battered and rusting, and the paint is faded and discolored. It appears to have been anchored, but the water has receded and now it remains beached. It's been there a while as indicated by the lush growth of the grass where the water used to be.",Yes,"The clothing the men are wearing is from decades ago, as proven by the extremely short ties and the cut of one man's jacket. The photo itself is sepia and grainy, showing that the photo was taken with an old camera.",Unsure,"I believe this is a modern hotel decorated in a somewhat retro fashion. I see some ""vintage"" furniture in the photo, but the design of the house itself doesn't feel vintage. In addition, the photo is crisp and clear which would seem to indicate a newer camera took it.",Yes,"It is a picture showing the evolution of cell phones. From right to left: an old nigh-indestructible Nokia, a Motorola Razr, Blackberries or Palm Pilots, and what look to be early iPhones with touch screens. Technology ages much faster than other things, so the Nokia may only be 20 years old but in terms of cell phone tech it is verging on ancient.",Strongly Agree,"I tried to write at least two sentences for each photo, and expanded on my choice with examples and justification.",Agree,"Same as above: I tried to write at least two sentences for each photo, and expanded on my choice with examples and justification. However, this was a small sampling of photos, and future images may be quite different to the point that my explanations may not be applicable.","Sometimes the concept ""old"" needs context. For example, I mentioned that cell phones can be only 20 years old, but in terms of cell phone technology, they're rather ancient. Another example was a hotel room with some retro furniture (desk chair and bedside tables), which I doubted was old because the picture was clear and the colors were bright. If a photo of something genuinely old has been through post-processing to sharpen, brighten, and colorize the image, it can give the impression that the photo was taken much more recently.",,15,Yes,"the paint is peeling, the wood is rotting away not smooth. there is rust on the metal",Yes,the paint on the boat is peeling off. The boat is sitting on dry land. the boat is in disaray,Yes,the picture itself is black and white the style of clothing is outdated,No,things are bright and shiny nothing is run down or shabby looking,Yes,phones with keyboards and that flip open are old style,Neutral,humans understand concepts but I don't believe computers do.,Neutral,humans understand concepts but I don't believe computers do.,concepts are more of a feeling and computers have no feeling,,16,Yes,This was once a useful item but it is now just old and broken. The paint is weathered and the clock is in pieces. It has been around for a long time.,Yes,The boat is old. it is weathered and worn it is not being used and is in disrepair.,Yes,this is an old photo. the photo is grainy and the clothes they are wearing are out of date.,No,Everything in this room is fresh and looks modern and new.,Yes,These phones are not modern the technology has moved along and they are no longer in production.,Agree,It is easy to see right away I think I described it well.,Neutral,I think I would need some more examples.,I would like to show the computer some people .,,17,Yes,The paint on the door is peeling. The clock looks broken. It looks as though from the top board that there was a fire and that the clock fell down. It also looks like there is an old and dirty tire around the clock. It looks like junk was placed up against an old door.,Yes,"The boat in the picture looks old, rusty and broken. The paint is scuffed, it looks like there are dents in the boat. It looks very dirty. A new boat would look clean and shiny with new paint. The windows would not be broken and it wouldn't have dents in it.",Yes,This looks like an old picture. It is a black and white photo. It also is not very clear. It is quite grainy. Photo technology has come a long way. Newer pictures are much clearer even if they are in black and white.,No,The room looks newer based on the lamps next to the headboard that are wired inside the walls so that you don't see the cords. The nightstands also look like a newer concept. They are sleek and simple. The lighted area with frosted glass definitely looks like a newer concept. The metal chair on the bottom right also looks newer - sleek and simple.,Yes,"The phones in this picture are old. They are flip phones as well as phones with key pads. Newer technology uses a touch screen. The two phones on the left are touch screen. However, matched with the older phones, I would guess that these are some of the first touch screen phones. If the majority of the phones were touch screen, I would not consider this picture old.",Agree,I feel that I was fairly thorough but the picture with the clock was difficult to explain.,Agree,I feel I did well overall with my descriptions but the one with the clock was hard.,I should have described what new looks like as a comparison.,,18,Yes,"The worn, flaking paint and rough wood suggest age.",Yes,"The boat is in disrepair; since it takes time for a boat to fall into a state of disrepair, this suggests old.",Yes,"The men in the picture aren't themselves very old, but the style of dress suggests this is an old picture. That the picture is grainy and not sharp black and white also suggests it is an old picture taken on a film camera.",No,Nothing in the room is broken or dusty. The furniture and interior look to be contemporary designs. Neither of these things suggest age.,Unsure,"It might suggest old in that some of the phones pictured seem to be older models and styles, but old is a relative concept.",Strongly Disagree,I can think of similar images that would not convey the concept old.,Strongly Disagree,Old is a fairly abstract concept. It requires understanding a lot of cues and context to decide if something represents an abstraction like that.,Some things that are not old are intentionally made to appear old.,,19,Yes,This looks burned and like it has been setting a while. The clock look damaged and the door also.,Unsure,Looks like a painting that is hard to judge. There is a old boat that makes this picture look older. Landscaping looks up to date though.,Yes,The photo is in black and white. The style of clothing looks outdated and old fashion.,Yes,The furniture looks older and the closets outdated.,Yes,Compare to the phones we have now they are out of date. There are button on the phone and some of these slide or flip up.,Agree,Identified what older looks like and how things have changed.,Agree,Compared it to things that are out now.,none,,20,Yes,The clock is broken and the paint is peeling. These are signs of age. This picture is of something that is old.,Yes,The boat is rusted and the paint is peeling. These are clear signs of age. The boat is old.,Yes,This photo is grainy and in black and white. Most black and white photos are old. Another sign of age is the graininess. Older photos don't have good quality. The style of dress on the men is old also.,No,Everything in this room looks nice and neat. This is not an example of old. If things were in bad repair then it would probably be old but this is not.,Yes,These are older model phones so they can be classified as old. Most phones do not look like this now. They look more like the phones on the left but those are older model iphones.,Strongly Agree,I think the computer can identify older things based off my explanation.,Agree,There will be some signs of age that wasn't covered but it should be able to see most old things.,none,,21,Yes,"It looks like the he lock on the door is rusting, which happens when things metal gets old I think. The clock also looks pretty old judging by the crack in the glass and the design.",Unsure,"The boat looks like it may be pretty old, however it might just be dirty. You really do not know for sure judging by looking at the photo itself.",Yes,"The photo is in black and white, which pretty much always means that the photo is from years back then. This is because all photos were black and white at one point because they could not be printed in color yet.",Unsure,"The room looks to be relatively new, however the table the lamp is sitting on looks to be pretty antique. I do not know for sure but I would guess it was pretty old.",Yes,The phones in the photo are forms years ago. Phones nowadays appear to look much different from the ones in the photo. Ask the iphones look like the earlier versions.,Neutral,"There are so many old items, I can't say that with just 5 photos I taught the system.",Disagree,It would take many more images for the computer to thoroughly be able to distinguished old items.,N.a,,22,Yes,"Rust! Rust is a big sign that something is old and there's enough rust in this picture to suggest whatever we're looking at is very old. Also notice the chipping and peeling of the paint, revealing a different color underneath. Broken things suggest oldness too, like the broken clock here.",Yes,"The boat here is old. It is run down, it's paint is chipping and revealing multiple different hues under the top layer of paint which would indicate it has had lots of time to wear down. It is also on a dry lake bed which would indicate it has been there a long time.",Yes,"black and white pictures are no longer common, and are considered old in general. The clothes the men are wearing in the picture have also not been in fashion for several decades. short ties means old. Black and white means old.",No,"Everything is very clean, the paint is all uniform and only changes color when it meets a new color. There are no cracks in the tile, and the whites are still white, which usually turn a dingy yellow if given enough time.",Yes,This picture has somewhat new phones on the left side of the image and fairly old phones on the right side. It is a timeline of sorts in which very old and very new are shown with varying stages of change in between them. This picture shows the concept of old and new.,Neutral,There are so many different definitions and applicable eccentricities in what may or may not be considered old that trying to teach the robot seems a bit impossible.,Disagree,again there are way too many ideas of what old is that im sure it'd miss some in the future just based on what i told it.,"i should have mentioned wrinkles on things, gray hair, vibrations in old cars, lack of symmetry...so many things",,23,Yes,There is a wall with peeling paint. There is a clock that has a cracked face. There is a bicycle tire hanging on the wall. There are splinters on wood next to the wall.,Yes,"The boat appears old because it has faded paint and no paint in some spots. It may be painted wood. It is aground, not in the water. The boat cabin is made of wood.",No,There are men of different ages. Nobody has gray hair. They may be all under age 50 or so.,No,There is a modern look to the room. There is smoothness everywhere in the photo. This looks like a modern bedroom.,Unsure,There are several phones and some look several years old. Some are not smart phones. They have very small keys under a small screen on the outside of the phone. One phone has a large nub antenna.,Disagree,The computer needs a lot more examples of what looks old.,Disagree,"Lots of examples of what is old are needed, and there were only a few.","I have not listed things like wrinkles or stooped posture. There is no torn or worn out clothing. I missed the opportunity to try to identify the photo itself as old, which might be whether it is in color or black and white.",,24,Yes,"There appears to be damage, either from time or water, which indicates it is probably old.",Yes,The boat is weathered and in need of paint. The wood has rotted and needs repair. It has been neglected and left out in the elements.,Yes,"The photograph is in black and white and depicts army uniforms which were worn in the past. Also, the hairstyles are like those worn by men long ago.",No,The furnishings are modern-looking and very clean.,No,"Cellular phones are basically a modern technological invention, and since all of them still have the capability of working as a telephone, they at not old.",Agree,"This was a difficult concept to convey, but I think a computer could get the gist.",Disagree,I'm sure there's something more I could have explained had I thought of it.,not sure,,25,Yes,"the paint is chipping, the wood is rotting and is dicolored as well as the metal. This constitutes old.",Yes,"the boat is discolored, rusty, paint is chipping and missing as well as the metal. It is also abandoned.",Yes,"photos are not taken in black and white anymore, therefore it is old. Also, the clothing in the photos is of not modern era.",No,"the area in the photo looks modern, not aged which would constitute old.",Yes,"the evolution of phones are shown showing current models (smartphones) as well as old models (flip phone, candy bar phones & type pad phones) many of the phones shown are outdated and old.",Agree,i explained what constitutes something being old,Agree,I have given specific examples of what can determine something to be old,nothing,,26,Yes,The concept of old is shown here because this object clearly is rotting and peeling. It is at the end of its life. It has to have been around for a very long time for the elements to have gotten to it like that.,Yes,"This boat is rusted and rotting, clearly it has been sitting there for a very long time for it to look like that. The paint is no longer fresh, it is falling apart. And the fact that it has been left out in the open like that suggests that its previous owner abandoned it.",Yes,"The image is black and white and all of the men pictured, while young, are now old. The reason I know this is because current standards of photography do not involve black and white pictures. Also, the picture clearly has been around a very long time and it is not digital because of the defects I can clearly see on it. Also these men have a clothing style that is outdated now.",No,"The room is modern themed. The colors are bright and stark. i do not see any old objects, or anything that is of a style that is not modern. There are updated electronics, and the shower looks new. The chair in the corner is a very new looking chair.",Yes,"These cell phones are outdated, old models. None of them are new, they are all much larger than the current cell phones we use today. Plip phones and blackberries are a thing of the past. The slide out keyboards and large screens, also the type of buttons they use, all are old. New phones don't have buttons like that.",Strongly Agree,"I have explained all the reasons why I was thinking what I did, so it should be able to hopefully emulate my observations.",Strongly Agree,because all it has to do is to look for what I looked for and replicate it,"there are plenty of things that it doesn't know still, and that depends on what kinds of images it were to see. I was assuming that you'd show it similar images. For new images, like for example living beings like animals, you would need to know different details as far as biological aging, etc. And there is no possible way I could have covered that in just a few paragraphs.",,27,Yes,This is old because you can see the wear and tear on it. The paint is peeling and looks like whatever it is was around for a very long time.,Yes,"The boat in this image is old, you can tell there is alot of wear and tear on it from the environment. It was sitting out there for a while.",Yes,You can tell this is old because of the outfits they are wearing and the fact that the picture is not in color. It was taken a very long time ago.,No,This is all stuff that looks new and modern. Nothing in this picture is old. Everything is current and looks very nice.,Yes,"These are cell phones, they are not very old but in technology terms they are old phones. There are many newer models that make these very outdated.",Strongly Agree,My definitions of Old were very clear and I helped describe the concept well.,Strongly Agree,My definition and description of old was clear and helps it understand the difference between old and new.,"None, i feel like my examples were good enough.",,28,Yes,The paint has deteriorated. There is rust that has eaten through the metal. There appears to be burn marks on it.,Yes,There is a boat that is laying on the ground and run down. It is deteriorated and decrepit. The paint on the boat is chipped off. There is rust on it too.,Yes,The photo is old because there is no color to it. The photo is grainy and low definition.,No,There is nothing old in the picture. The image is in color. The decor is sleek and modern and looks new.,Yes,There are phones and smartphones in the picture. The technology shown is not old.,Disagree,I think that explaining whether something is old is very subjective. To somebody something might be old but to another person it may not be.,Disagree,Old is a subjective description. It is hard to determine if something is old or not.,I can't think of any.,,29,Yes,It is old because the paint is peeling on the wood. There is rust present which indicates it has been sitting there for a long time. The wood on the frame is deteriorating which also indicates it has been there a long time.,Yes,There seems as if there was water at one point which is now gone and the boat has been sitting in that place for a long time which can be seen by the fading of the paint and it is falling apart.,Yes,Their style of dress indicates it was from a long ago era. The photo is not of great quality and seems to be yellowing which indicates age.,No,The room looks fresh and modern with modern amenities in it and the bed looks clean and up to date.,Yes,The style of the cell phones is old. These phones were used in the early 2000's which isn't very old but old when it comes to electronics.,Strongly Agree,I gave indicators as to what to look for to determine the age of the image and the objects in it.,Strongly Agree,When it determines the attributes that were present in the old photos it can apply that to future images it will see.,"How to determine if people are old by graying hair, etc. and attributes of human aging.",,30,Yes,"There is a lot of rust and peeled paint. The surface is not smooth, but rather rough and scratched.",Yes,The boat looks rusty and discolored. It looks like there are many broken parts as well. It looks like it's been abandoned and has been there for a long time.,Yes,"The image is a photo that is black and white, and has a grainy texture. It's not a very clear image like modern photos.",No,I don't see anything old in this picture. Everything in this picture has a smooth surface and crisp colors. Nothing looks broken or damaged.,Yes,They are all old models of cell phones. Cell phones that has a screen on the top half and the key pads on the bottom half of the surface is usually old.,Neutral,"I think it can tell if it's another old photograph that is black and white with a grainy texture. I don't think it can tell an old photo that has color, though. I also don't know if computers can tell what ""peeled paint and rust"" looks like.",Disagree,"There are too many things that can fit into the concept ""old"" and that wasn't enough to cover the different cases.","The concept is too broad to teach it to recognize everything old. There was no pictures representing ""old age"" for example, like a grandmother.",,31,Yes,The paint surface is worn and peeling. The wood seems to be damaged and old as well. Much of the damage could have been done be time in addition to fire. The wood on the left is also splintering like happens over time.,Yes,This photo illustrates the concept of old because one of the main elements in it is an old boat. It's possible to tell the boat is old because the paint is peeling and it is generally worn down. It seems to be broken and obviously not in use as it's not in water most likely because it's old and in disrepair.,Yes,"It's possible to tell this photo is old because the style of clothing is from a number of years ago, perhaps the 40's or 50's. In addition, the photo is black and white which is an indication that the photo was taken in a time when there wasn't any capability for color photos.",No,There really isn't anything to indicate the concept of old in this image. The style of the bed and furniture could really be from now or a few years ago. The room feels kind of modern and there is nothing specifically dated from the past.,Yes,"This looks like it illustrates the idea of old because it seems to show a lot of older style phones. Many of these styles are from years ago and either not used or rarely used any more. Most phoned today have digital screens on which you press the characters instead of buttons. Also, most phones no longer have antennas on them.",Agree,I tried to define what was old in each image that seemed to illustrate the concept. I tried to specifically name the details of why the things were old.,Agree,I hope so. I think I indicated that in each instance something was old and so in future images these elements would have to be present.,Maybe I should've indicated more clearly that in order for an image to communicate the them of being old it should specifically have an element that is worn in some way or has elements from the past in it.,,32,Yes,This is considered old because it is falling apart due to the elapsed time it has sat there.,Yes,Anything that is decaying because of the amount of time it has sat there is considered old.

When things get old they start to deteriorate as you see in the picture.,Yes,The boat in the picture is faded in color and very rusty. It is also not in a body of water which means at one point there may have been a water source here but it has since dried up which displays that a lot of time has past since the boat was originally placed here.,Unsure,The picture is in black and white which can symbolize oldness but new pictures can be styled in this way as well. There is no definitive way to know when the picture was taken because there are no markers that you can rely on to tell you the time period.,No,There are no definitive markers to display whether the room is old or not it could be styled for an old look without the items being old there is no way to be absolutely sure whether it is old or not.,Yes,This picture show different generations of phones and how technology has progressed over the years as you move from left to right the phones become less and less advanced which shows the age of the phones and how technology has progressed over the years which makes the phone on the far right very old.,Strongly Agree,Explained what to look at to deduce oldness and how it can sometimes be ambiguous.,Strongly Agree,I gave the computer clues to tell but this is a harder thing to distinguish.,More pictures that are old with markers that can allow you to definitely say that it is old.,,36,Yes,The peeling paint means years have worn it away and it is old.The rust also indicated that this is old.,Yes,"The boat is old because it looks weathered.

The white's are bright whites. They don't look discolored or rusty.",Yes,"These phones are old models of cellphones. No one uses these models anymore and therefore are old.

The wood has begun to rot and is turning a different color. The boat is starting to deteriorate.,Yes,"Most pictures are taken in color within the modern day. This photo is a black and white photo.

The bed is a platform style bed which is modern. The floor has tile and carpet. There is no discoloration that can be seen with the flooring or within the walls. The chair at the desk looks modern and is not wooden like most old chairs.,Yes,"There are flip-phones in the photo. Also, there are phones known as Blackberry. These phones are not seen much anymore. Most phones are now smart phones. There are two smartphones in the photo, but they look like older iPhones. The old iPhones were thicker than the new iPhones.",Agree,"I have given very distinct features that would allow the computer to judge between new and old. Some photos are harder to allow the computer to detect if a photo is old or not, but it should be able to do so by looking for specific things within photos. I have given the computer a variety of things that would determine whether a photo was old or not.",Agree,"I feel that I have not completely taught the computer to identify any image because it is impossible with so few photos. Every photo is unique and there are certain things within each photo. I believe that I have taught the computer to be able to identify a good portion of photos, but it is not thorough enough.","I did not teach the computer the concept of noticing flaws within materials as much as I should have. I think the computer would be better able to judge on oldness based on specific criteria such as torn material, discolored material, etc.",,39,Yes,"In this photo, the paint on the door is chipping. This usually only happens after paint has been on something for a very long time, so it feels like this door is old. The clock is also broken, which gives and impression of being old.",Yes,"The boat in this picture looks like it's been around a while. There are lots of holes and rust, which happen over time as an object ages. The fact that you couldn't bring this out to water makes it feel even older,since at one point, it was new and able to do things like carry people on a lake. The paint is also chipping and older.",Yes,"Black and white photos almost always seem old,since color photos were only available after a certain point in history. Additionally, clothing changes over time,and the clothing that these guys are wearing looks more dated. Most men don't dress up so nicely today, especially in suits. The material of the clothes also looks nicer and different than what most men wear today.",No,"This bedroom has a lot of modern fixtures. Some of the stuff looks outdated by visual cue, but it is a complete bedroom. It has a nice matress, light fixtures, what looks like a vacuum, and other items that look unused and mostly modern. The floor is clean, as well.",Yes,"So, technology always changes. Especially now, we're moving really quickly away from old technology onto newer and better things. This picture contains a lot of cell phones that you can tell are old by looking at them. On the far left, there is a new phone. You know this,because it has a touch screen. Older phones are flip phones or have inferior technology.",Agree,There were many different ways to describe the term old,Agree,"I think the computer has a general idea of aging.

I think a lot more would be done to fully explain. old can pertain to many many things,Disagree,"I think there would be problems for example in situations that pertain to style. the object in question might like new, like a well kept collectible car, but actually be very old. I think more would be done to explain the difference between something that looks old and something that is many years old.","differentiation between aged appearance and age in years and relative age. relative age would be the consideration of how old the object is relative to other objects for the same use. like the smartphone example. 3 years might not really be that long a time, but its an eternity when it comes to smartphones",,41,Unsure,"The items are worn and weathered.

Old can be relative and mimic other concepts such as condition affected by other means than time.,Disagree,Old covers a lot of territory and is difficult to explain accurately. Some things may appear old but are not old or vice versa.,Better describing what weathered and rusted and concept such as these are and how they can be identified.,,42,Yes,"This is old because it is showing much wear. It has been aged by time. Time is what makes something old. The more time goes by, the older something is.",Yes,"This boat is old because it is in need of paint.

Also describe the outdated cell phones.,Neutral,Im not sure about this. There are probably many other attributes that make things look old.,That things dont need to be falling apart to look old.

I also mentioned the appearance of old in each photo.,I taught the computer about items that are not old but appear to be made to look old.,,55,Yes,"The picture shows an old item because rust and damage is present, when things are in this state they are usually old because people don't use them anymore.",Yes,"There is an object present that would normally not be there, a boat on land.

There are different things in the picture that suggest old but there are also things that make the room look new. The wooden doors look old style but that could be a bring back from the past.

I know these phones can still be used today and some people do.,Agree,Because I gave reasons for my answers that a computer may be able to use as guidlines for making its own determination.,Agree,I gave explanations of what happens to objects that have been sitting around or been exposed to natural elements over long periods of time.,Nothing that I can think of.,,62,Yes,These items are clearly old as they have rusted. We know this is a reaction takes time to occur. This lets us know these items are not new or fresh and are therefore the opposite. We can also note that old things often have fallen into disrepair or will often look well used.,Yes,"This image depicts things that are old. Our first clue is that things do not look new or fresh, they instead appear to have been here for quite some time. You can see the disrepair on the boat which tells us this item has been here for some time. Time is the key to being old. If we can say this object has endured for some time, seen the passage of time, we know it is old.",Yes,"This image is old. We can first tell it is old by the color and look of the photo. It is old because it is from the distant past. This is not a new or fresh item. It is the opposite, old. Old will refer to the time something was created or its age in some cases.",No,"This image is not old. We are able to tell this because things appear to be very modern. We would describe this room and furnishings as new and fresh, this means they could not be the opposite; old. Note that old things rarely look very clean or bright.",Yes,Old is a relative concept which involves time. A thing is considered old when it is from the past. These items are old because they were released some time ago. Generally something old will be from years past. Something old is the opposite of new or fresh.,Strongly Agree,I feel I have thoroughly explained old and ways to identify it. I have given various steps to eliminate things that are not old and qualify things that are. I think the computer will have a great chance of identifying old things.,Strongly Agree,I feel I have stressed that old relates to the passage of time however we may discover that has occurred. I think I clearly expressed the concept that this something that is not completely qualitative and sometimes a bit of judgement is needed to determine yes or no answers.,"That the concept of old is relative. This is subject to opinion, not an absolute.",,63,Unsure,"The distressed paint and broken suggest age, but this could have happened five minutes ago. This one is tricky to narrow down, because ""old"" is a very broad term.",Yes,"The distress on the boat suggests a fair amount of aging over a long period of time. Considering how far away from water the boat is, and how it is left out in the natural elements, this could be considered old.",Yes,"The image itself is old, though the people in the picture are not. The clothing and quality of the image suggest a long time ago.",Unsure,"The design suggests old, or more accurately, vintage, even though the decor and furnishings are clean and look new.",No,This is more of a timeline of cellular phones than any suggestion of old. In fact some of these previous designs are still being manufactured today as budget phones.,Disagree,"It is too broad a term to really narrow down with five pictures. There are a lot of ambiguities with the word, and no, real proper explanation without context.",Disagree,"I don't feel I can really explain ""old"" as a concept without having some kind of human understanding to get the context of what old could mean.",How old can mean many different things to many different people.,,64,Yes,The paint is peeling and there is tarnish. The clock is also old and not modern,Yes,The boat in the picture is an older style. Loss of paint,Yes,It is a black and white picture which usually means it is old.,No,This is not an old style of a room. This is more modern and up to date.,Yes,These are cell phones that are older than the cell phones available today.,Disagree,It was hard to describe the concept of this particular picture,Disagree,I felt as I I did not describe the concept well,none,,65,Yes,The photograph above could be considered relatively old. There is damage or wear shown to the clock device that could indicate that it has sat outside for a lengthy amount of time. Wear or pain deterioration is a long slow process so the kind of damage shown could take a considerable amount of years to occur.,Yes,When looking at the boat you can see that it is old. The way we know this is because of the condition of the pain and exterior of the boat. Fresh or new paint would look clean and bright whereas the image shows signs of deterioration in the paint and metal of the boat. This condition suggests that the boat has been in weather for a considerable amount of time and is probably relatively old and not new.,Yes,"The picture above can be considered old. Modern or recent photography is of a much higher quality than what is shown in the picture. You will notice that the picture has a grainy or fuzzy quality about it. This shows it was taken with older technology than of todays standards. Also you may notice the outfits shown, were ones that were commonly in fashion a relatively long time ago so it may indicate that this photograph is old. Also photos today are typically in color although not always. Color was not available for photos taken a long time ago.",No,The picture show is of something new or relatively young in age. Each object in the room looks to be in good condition as if it was just created or bought. No items in the room show deterioration or damage to suggest that there has been use for any length of time. Generally if there are no signs of use or damage then something is new and not old.,Yes,In the photo above there is older phone technology shown. We known that it is old as the models shown are much bulkier in design and have less of the modern features that phones have today. Also you may observe wear and damage on some of the items shown. Modern or new phones today are much smaller and thinner with larger screens used for interacting. The phones shown were created before that kind of technology existed so we can assume the phones are old.,Neutral,I tried to give examples as to why the different images may be old or not. It is difficult to explain the concept of age to a machine so the best I could come up with is explain length of time or whether the image showed a particular time period in which to gauge the images age. I also explained that deterioration of something is a slow process and can show that the object is old.,Agree,I pointed out clues in each image that can indicate that something is old or not. The condition of the items shown or the time period that something is possibly from can indicate its age. Older technology can be compared to today which can show that something is older.,"There were no images of people to show that they are old, and just because something is in bad condition does not necessarily make it old although it is often the case. I had a relatively hard time with this one due to the fact that machines do not experience time in the same sense we do so it may be very difficult for the machine to relate to the concept.",,66,Yes,"I checked the image for people or objects. Then since there was an object, I checked for dirt, or rust, or peeling paint or broken things to determine if it was old.",Yes,"I first checked the image for people or objects. If I found an object, I checked to see if it was broken, or dirty or rusty, which would indicate that it was old.",Yes,"I checked to see if the image had people or objects in it. THen since the image itself was sepia toned, I could say the picture was old. The people in the image are adults and the men have receding hairlines, which also makes then older too.",No,"I looked at the picture to see if there were any people or animals that looked old, or furniture that looked dingy/well used or anything with rust.",Unsure,"I checked the image for people or objects. Then I checked to see if the objects were dirty, or broken or rusty. I also checked to see if the objects in the image were outdated or from some time ago.",Disagree,I feel its a difficult concept for a computer to grasp since there are many variables with objects or people.,Disagree,Its hard to tell if objects are old if they are well preserved antiques. Its hard to teach all the different variables that might make an object or person old.,"How to identify if an object might be an antique and what features to look for in people like receding hairlines, gray hair or wrinkles.",,67,Yes,"As a human, I assume that an object that looks decayed,rotting, wrinkly, and otherwise used, is old. That is how this particular door and everything on it looks.",Yes,"As a human, I assume that an object that looks decayed,rotting, wrinkly, and otherwise used, is old.That is how this boat looks.",Yes,"As a human, I assume that an object that looks decayed,rotting, wrinkly, and otherwise used, is old.The men in the picture don't look old, but the photo quality is grainy as well as black and white so you know it is old.",No,"As a human, I assume that an object that looks decayed,rotting, wrinkly, and otherwise used, is old. This room does not look old in any way.",Yes,"As a human, I assume that these phones were used in the 2000s and are outdated. So basically, they are old.",Strongly Agree,I feel my description of what is old fit everything well.,Disagree,Most of the pictures were old looking with few that did not look old.,n/a,,68,Yes,The doors paint is peeling and scrapped it is old,No,This painting is a new creation,Yes,this photo is in black and white therefore it is old,Yes,vintage decor could be considered old,Yes,Some of these things are outdated,Neutral,im not sure,Disagree,this was tough im not sure,i dont know,,69,Yes,This would be considered old. You can see chipped paint which shows that something is old.,Yes,You can see chipped paint on this boat which would make it seem like something has sat for years or is old.,Yes,"Judging by the style of outfits in this photo and also the black and white color, you can tell this would be a photo take years ago, so it would be old.",No,"This picture contains no chipped paint or rusted items, everything is clean and bright, which would not be old.",Yes,"These phones are all outdated phones, so they would be considered old.",Disagree,It is hard to explain the concept of old.,Neutral,"I gave certain things to look for but I can not be sure they would help, explaining old is a bit hard.",no,,70,Yes,"The image of the object is tattered, broken and rusty. There are parts that are broken and worn down because of old age and time.",Yes,The image of the boat shows wear and tear. It also has rust and shows usage. It is not new and had been battered over the years. Paint is missing.,Yes,This image demonstrates old by the black and white photograph that is slightly yellowed. The clothing is dated to an earlier time as well as the hairstyles.,No,The image has a new and moderinized look. Everything is new and not used. It is not worn or tattered.,Unsure,"Although outdated, this image displays a newer technology. They are not battered or broken. They are hard more likely older models.",Strongly Agree,I have clearly defined the differences between old and new. Used and unused.,Strongly Agree,"The computer has the definitions and guidelines of old: torn, tattered, rusty, broken.","There are some objects that are a middle ground - i.e. the cell phones. They are not broken, however they are older.",,71,Yes,"There is no object in this photo which is modern in design. All the items look well used and perhaps a bit ""tired."" All these objects can be termed ""old.""",Yes,"Let it be a given that the earth and sky are ""old."" There is also a boat in the photo, and the boat is in bad repair and the paint on the boat is well worn. Everything in this photo can be termed ""old.""",Yes,"The photo above is in the colors of black and white. Sometimes such photos can be termed ""old."" ""And the photo is grainy--the black and white colors are not always consistent in texture: that is also a hint that the photo is ""old."" Also, the clothing fashion worn by the men appears very dated, which is another way to say ""old."" Although some of the men in this photo appear young, they are very old by now.",No,"All items in this photo look modern, so there is nothing in this photo which appears to be or can be called ""old.""",Unsure,"The cell phones in this photo may or may not be old. From the information presented, it is hard to tell if there are old cell phone in this photo or not, although it *does* appear that some of them may be.",Agree,"I did a good job--although i can think of improvements now--that would guide a robot to understand the concept of ""old."" I gave hints about how to determine ""old"": fashion, the graininess of photographs, lack of repair (the boat) and such like.",Agree,"I think so for the same reasons given in the above text box. I gave hints about how to determine ""old"": fashion, the graininess of photographs, lack of repair (the boat) and such like.","Can't think of anything. ""Old"" is hard to define for a robot (let alone people).",,72,Yes,This image show old aging peeling paint.

It looks like it is damaged and the color has been worn out over the years.,Yes,The boat in the image is old and worn down. You can tell from the discoloration on the boat.,Yes,This is a black and white photo to indicate being an old image. Also the clothing the people are wearing are also old.,No,There isn't anything in this image that shows anything old. Everything in here looks new.,Yes,This shows images in order from youngest to oldest. The oldest phones are to the right.
