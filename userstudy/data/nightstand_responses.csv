The table has a small surface, a drawer, and four legs. It also holds a lamp, which nightstands often do.",Yes,"There is a small table between the two beds. This table is called a nightstand.

There could be other styles that are missed, even if somewhat similar.",Neutral,"The angles, determining if the location is a bedroom and whether the style differs a lot might keep the computer from recognizing a nightstand is in the picture. All 3 of the nightstands shown were different.","I think I described a few variations based on what was shown in three examples.

These are dining tables, which are large enough to sit at. Nightstands are usually much smaller than dining tables.",No,The absence of a bed is the main thing that tells one these pieces of furniture are not nightstands.,Neutral,I'm not sure how good the computer will be at identifying relevant similarities and differences.,Strongly Disagree,I feel there must be so many variations possible that that can't be the case.,"The top of the nightstand is usually at the height of the mattress. Nightstands usually won't have chairs pulled up to them. Alarm clocks are a big tip-off for nightstands.",,19,Yes,"Is in bedroom and on side of bed, has books and lamps on it.",Yes,Is in between beds which is also possible.Clock and phone on there which is acceptable.,Yes,nightstand by bed has a lamp and books on it.,No,"Not by a bed, not small drawer.",No,"this is a tv stand, night stands are by beds and in bedrooms usually.",Agree,Told the traits of a nightstand and room usually found in.,Agree,"Got it right in the end, told what not to look for.",none,,20,Yes,There are two nightstands in this picture.

There is a shelf but it has multiple shelves on it with a lot of items. A nightstand would only have the one surface area on the top for items to be put on it.

It looks like a drawer, but I think a nightstand can also look like a table.",Yes,The nightstand is the drawer next to the bed with the lamp on it. It is a nightstand because it is next to the bed and you can place objects on it.,Unsure,"Well it depends what is considered a nightstand. There are chairs and tables, as it is a restaurant scene.",Unsure,Sometimes people call that table in front of the television a night stand as well.

Also there just nothing here that even comes close to resembling a night stand.",Agree,"because nightstands are very specific, a nightstand next to a couch is not a nightstand, it's an end table.

It has a lamp and other small items on it.,Yes,There is a nightstand in the picture. A nightstand usually is a small table next to a bed. It usually has a lamp and other small items on it which this image includes.,No,There is no bed in the picture. A nightstand is a table that is next to a bed. The tables in the pictures are part of a dining room.,No,There is no bed in the picture. A nightstand is next to a bed in a bedroom. The stands in the picture are part of an entertainment center.,Strongly Agree,A nightstand is easy to explain. It is an easy to spot item that has a specific location.,Strongly Agree,A nightstand is easy to explain. It has to be next to a bed and a bed is easy to discern.,None.,,29,Yes,"Again, there is a piece of furniture that is next to a bed that holds necessary items that need a steady surface while lying in bed such as a lamp and books.",Yes,There is a piece of furniture next to a bed that holds necessary items such as a lamp that you will use while lying in bed.,Yes,There is a piece of furniture that is next to a bed that holds a lamp and necessary items that need a steady surface while lying in bed.,No,A nightstand is usually not present in a public space and it is usually a piece of furniture that is next to a bed.,No,The piece of furniture is not next to a bed and does not contain objects needed to be reached while in bed.,Strongly Agree,It has learned that a nightstand must be next to a bed.,Agree,It will look for objects such as a bed and a lamp to indicate it is a nightstand.,That a nightstand can be used elsewhere in the home and not necessarily next to a bed but it would be out of place.,,30,Yes,"This is a bedroom, where you usually find nightstands. There is a nightstand, it has four legs, is short and has a lamp on it. It also has a small drawer.",Yes,"It's a bedroom where you usually find nightstands. There is a nightstand with a lamp on it. It has four legs, about the same height as the beds. It also has a drawer.",Yes,This is a bedroom. There is a small table next to the bed that is at the same height as the bed. It also has a lamp on it. So I can conclude that it's a nightstand.,No,"This is not a bedroom, where you usually see nightstands next to beds. There is nothing in the photo that looks like a nightstand. All you see on the floor are dining tables and chairs.",No,There is no bed in this picture. Anything that looks like a table is too high to be a nightstand (higher than a bed) and doesn't have a lamp on top.,Agree,"I think I gave a typical condition where you can find a nightstand, and what it needs to look like to be considered a nightstand.",Neutral,"If there was no reference material in the image, like a nightstand just by itself on a white backdrop, I don't know if the computer will recognize it.",It may not always have a lamp on it. Some nightstands don't have any drawer.,,31,Yes,"I used the fact that I know a nightstand is a small table by a bed used to hold objects. Usually the table is pretty small compared to say, a dining table. Many times the nightstand is just made big enough to hold small items that one might use while getting ready to fall asleep such as books, a glass of water, a watch that's been taken off, tissues, or other smaller items. Many times a nightstand already has a light on it used to illuminate things until sleep. It's usually used while falling asleep instead of an overhead light because it's close and can be easily turned off from bed.",Yes,I know there is a nightstand in the photo because I see a small table that is about the height of both beds and right next to them. The table is serving the function of a nightstand in that it is a table withing arm's reach of the bed so that it can be accessed without getting out of bed. The nightstand also has a double lamp which is another clue that it's a nightstand because the light can be easily turned off when one is ready to sleep.,Yes,"There is a very small table about the same height of and next to a bed. This is pretty much the definition of a nightstand. Also, the table has a lamp on it, usually on nightstands. The table is also small, another feature of most nightstands. It seems to be being used as a surface for things used at night such as a book for reading and the lamp which can be easily reached because it is right next to the bed so it's not necessary to get up to turn it off.",No,"I know there is no nightstand because there is not bed in the photo. That's the biggest clue. Also, the tables that are present are much bigger, about 4 feet or so in diameter, rather than maybe a foot or so wide like most nightstands. In addition, there aren't any lamps on any of the tables. While nightstands don't always have lamps, they often do. These tables are for eating as demonstrated by the glassware, utensils and napkins on the surfaces.",No,"There is no bed in so that is the biggest clue that there is no nightstand. Normally a nightstand is used , like the name indicates, by a bed for use at night. Also, there are no small, bed height tables in view. In addition, the surfaces in view are all more shelves than tables. They aren't within arms reach of a bed which is the function of a nightstand.",Agree,"I think I was pretty detailed in my descriptions of what a nightstand is. I tried to be specific in my description of a nightstand's function and what physically consists of. Also, in the photos where there were no nightstands, I tried to tell the computer why the furniture pieces in it were not the same.",Agree,I defined the constraints of what a nightstand has to be. I also explained it's function so future items can hopefully be compared to these.,"Hmmm, I don't know if it needs anymore. Possibly I might have mentioned that nightstands are often wood and only about a foot or so in surface area.
