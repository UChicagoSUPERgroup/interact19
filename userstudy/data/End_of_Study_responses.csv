Subject #,Left Out Info ,Left Out Info - Why?,Human Comparison 1,Agree,once information was given previously didnt see a reason to repeat it,"if they were next to me i would point to attributes, would have been the same information though"2,Strongly Disagree,I didnt think to leave out anything i had already included.,You dont need to explain to a person as detailed of concepts because they can build their own thoughts and fill in blanks.3,Disagree,"I generally tried to repeat myself so that the ""computer"" could learn from repetition of principles. Also I found myself repeating principles or rules that occurred to me only in repetition.","I would have asked questions and invited questions. I would have quizzed the students on the concepts, and had them recognize sample concepts."4,Disagree,Reinforcement of information is important. I tried to include the information in subsequent explanations because it reinforces the concepts.,"Actually, I believe that these explanations were more suitable for a human. If I was actually teaching a computer, the rules would have been much more specific."5,Disagree,I always tried to make the computer recall the concepts explained before when it happened that they got repeated,"I think I'm not a good teacher, but I would have used the same method and, for sure, more examples, both with a human and with the computer. 5 picture are too few, I suggest you to go for 50 next time (and to raise to pay to $50 as well, lol :)"6,Agree,"For example, in the crossroad exercise, I didn't think 90 degree angles needed to be mentioned every time, although most commonly crossroads are, or that perpendicular lines were necessary to say every time. It seemed if the computer was learning from the series, having it described one way one time, and another way the next, would be more thorough and more beneficial.","Not sure. Perhaps go on youtube to find videos that show the process of eating, so the various steps are seen, for that example."7,Neutral,it is hard teaching a pc when i am not sure what it alreayd knows,i would have told it why more and epanded things better8,Agree,The timer was only one minute. Describing what was relevant in the current picture to train was more important. I couldn't know an exhaustive list of all qualities that applied or excluded a picture from the concept in any one picture.,"I would demonstrate some of the things that required an action, like eating. I would compare a photo to something I knew the other person was familiar with, either due to location or how it's known in culture. I would ask the person for feedback, in case the explanation was unclear. I would allow questions back to me do I could better explain the concept with what I know."9,Agree,I was only repeating what I had already said and there is only so much that can be said when the definition is very straight forward.,I would not have repeated myself so much or been so simplistic in my explanations.10,Disagree,I wanted to be as thorough as possible.,I would have described the opposite concept as a point of comparison.11,Neutral,no i didnt do that,nothing really.12,Disagree,Repetition helps with learning concepts.,nothing13,Disagree,"I wanted to explain myself completely in each photo. If the computer is not shown all the images, I want it to be able to understand with a single image that it does see.","I don't think there is anything I would do differently. All the concepts I explained, I would probably do when teaching a human too. Maybe not go in such great detail, but basically the same."14,Disagree,"Sometimes I repeated myself, but I tried to phrase it a little differently each time in order for the computer to integrate all descriptions.","I wouldn't change anything. I believe I wrote my explanations more as if a human was reading them, not a computer, so I believe all concepts would be easy for a human to grasp."15,Strongly Disagree,I described the concepts the best I could.,I would have included emotions or feelings.16,Disagree,I tried to restate as best as I can ore explain in a different way.,maybe some overlay or drawings.17,Disagree,I don't think that I did that for the most part. I tried to give descriptions based on the particular picture without taking into consideration the other descriptions that I gave.,I would probably give less details and have more expectations for a human to understand.18,Agree,I assumed that repeating the same idea would not be useful and that I should try to address different things in each picture to avoid such repetition.,"I would probably try to define the concepts accurately but fairly abstractly at first (depending on the concept) and then show specific examples only after the general concept/idea was understood. I also would assume (until told otherwise by the person) that the person would have a lot of background knowledge about the world (e.g., what a dinner table is, the difference between a road and rails); with the computer I have no sense of what (if anything) it understands."19,Neutral,I tried to tell as much information as possible given the picture.,More simpler terms20,Strongly Disagree,I tried to explain things about each individual picture.,I would have pointed things out and talked more.21,Disagree,I sort of repeated myself depending on the image.,I would have found out what exactly you guys meant by the terms given.22,Agree,repetition is insanity inducing.,been less friendly and less repetitive23,Agree,I probably did leave out repetitive information at some point.,I would have assumed a human would know certain concepts and would remember from former experiences. I would have used more examples in explaining to a human.24,Strongly Disagree,I didn't do this,I would have made a demonstration video and sent it to them.25,Agree,"once knowledge is gained, it is not necessary to repeat it multiple times generally.",nothing.26,Strongly Disagree,I reiterated the points to try and drive them home,I don't know. I think I wouldn't have needed to reiterate the concepts as much27,Strongly Disagree,I was as specific as possible in each example I was given.,"If teaching a person, I would be able to ask them if they had any questions about it. I could not do that with a computer."28,Agree,I thought that it would be redundant.,I would use emotion and more examples to explain.29,Strongly Disagree,The indicators for the four concepts are different.,Nothing30,Disagree,"I wrote down my thought patterns as I determined if the images contained the concepts or not. I wrote them down even if it was redundant, unless I unintentionally left it out.","For crossroads, I would have just said ""it's where two streets cross"" because a person would know what streets look like. People also wouldn't need me to explain in detail what ""eating"" is either, because they would know what ""eating"" is like."31,Neutral,I think I tried to define in each image what the idea was.,I maybe would've added a little bit of humor. I might of added some commentary that wasn't specifically functional. I think I stopped myself at time or two from adding detail like that because I wasn't sure the computer would understand it or not be confused by it.32,Disagree,I tried to include everything for each picture and be precise as possible.,I would try and tell them about different peoples perception and how they will differ from one another.33,Disagree,i may have left out information because i just forgot but i intended to repeat myself so they know what to look for.,"i would have gone more in depth, being able to vocalize it and explain more."34,Neutral,I am not sure if I left out information because it was in a prior example. I was asked to elaborate and give detail so I tried to do that each time.,I would have asked questions and had the human answer some questions as I went to see if it was understanding. I would have looked at the expressions of the human to gauge understanding.35,Agree,It didn't make since to write the same thing over and over again.,I would not have to use as much detail to explain because a human has the ability to pick up patterns.36,Agree,Because I was sounding redundant.,I don't think I would have said anything differently.37,Disagree,"i explained in each picture, so I repeated myself a lot to get the point of what I was describing across.",i might have used my hands when describing something.38,Disagree,"I gave the computer the same information each time. I would sometimes give a little more information to help the computer decipher differences, but overall it was the same. This would give the computer enough information without it having many different options to choose from.",I would show them more pictures and then I would have them identify to understand if they had learned the proper way to decipher differences in photos.39,Agree,"I felt like I didn't need to explain the basics again. I did that a lot in the first picture, but I left it out. I guess I assume it was like a human,and retained information","I would have them explain things back to me, to see if they understood it. I have no feedback if the computer understood anything I said."40,Disagree,"I don't think so, i think i tried to consistently repeat whatever elements I thought were pertinent","After a couple of examples, I would have let the human try to guess first, so that I can see whether or not they correctly are able to identify the concept, then I would have given feedback to their answer."41,Strongly Disagree,I took each image as if I was explaining the concept for the first time. I did not assume that any previous explanations were sufficient.,I would explain the concepts in different terms and use common identifying features. I would also better explain the concepts in a way familiar to a person rather than a computer.42,Disagree,Well not on purpose anyway. I wanted to repeat things so they would get it.,Probably nothing. The brain is a computer.43,Strongly Disagree,I did not left out information.,Nothing is differently .44,Agree,I guess I thought the computer would be looking at all of the examples in succession and would remember details from previous examples.,Probably not much. I bet I would have gotten follow up questions from a human.45,Disagree,"I don't think I did. whenever I saw something worth mentioning to make computers algorithm more precise I always did, even if I mentioned something similar previously.",That's totally different. A person has much more basic information and way more experience to understand more complex ideas or functions.46,Disagree,I didn't leave information out.,I wouldn't do anything differently if a human didn't know what something was.47,Disagree,I think every example was independent of the others.,I would have used general statements and compared it to other things or ideas that were common sense? It's hard to explain.48,Disagree,Explained each picture,Go faster49,Agree,I did not want to be redundant.,I would have taught a human the same way that I just tried to teach the computer.50,Disagree,Not that I recall.,Shown photos of what are the concept?51,Disagree,I dont think so. I remember mentioning plates many times. haha. But I tried to describe each image as its own.,I would mention smells and tastes and the feel of objects.52,Disagree,I tried to explain each image individually.,I would have asked the human what they thought before telling them the correct answer and then explaining the reason why.53,Disagree,I tried to keep my explanations contained to each picture example.,A human may be able to understand more abstract ideas. You may not have to break ideas down to the most basic concepts.54,Agree,It seemed redundant to repeat myself,Nothing. I spoke to the computer in the same manner I would have talked to a person.55,Disagree,"Each concept was unrelated, thus I taught them to the computer in a step by step way without relying on it knowing anything else.","I would have been more direct, as you can explain abstract concepts easier to a human without using steps to identify items."56,Strongly Disagree,I included as much information as needed,I would go step by step57,Agree,Because food on a plate is not eating. Food being served on a plate in a kitchen is not eating. Food going towards a mouth is considered eathing.,I would have first given definitions to the computer.58,Strongly Disagree,I repeated the information so the computer could learn in a repetitive fashion of the concepts.,nothing59,Strongly Disagree,i think i was through,nothing60,Strongly Disagree,I repeated information because they were the key points in identifying the concept on each images.,I don't think I would have done anything differently if I were teaching a human.61,Agree,Because I thought the computer would retain the information from the previous example.,I would not do much different. I would describe things in the same way.62,Disagree,I tried to look at each task individually. I aimed to teach each concept completely so that the computer would understand without other lessons. I did this because I felt it was the best way to ensure each thing was understood.,I would have used more examples being able to have a common base of understanding to build on with another human.63,Strongly Disagree,"I explained everything I thought I could, as well as I could, considering the circumstances (only 5 pictures per concept) and lack of context and understanding of certain concepts, especially ""old.""","I think a human would be able to better understand context, and would be able to differentiate between different meanings of the same or similar concepts."64,Disagree,I felt it was better to put more information to better understand the concept,nothing65,Disagree,Most of the concepts I attempted to teach the computer did not really relate to one another enough to where it might be useful to leave out information in future concepts.,If it were a human I would probably ask questions to help reinforce the concepts being taught. This would be similar to how teachers teach students in a class room. The repetition and questions help to teach the students and learn the material better. Also I would probably want a bigger variety of images to show the human as context makes it harder to understand something and a human might question things more.66,Strongly Disagree,I tried to be as thorough as possible in describing how I identified different things,I might have used more descriptive detail or left parts out since I would not have to teach a person if something was an animal or an object.67,Disagree,I tried to be thorough or post the exact same thing if it applied on the images.,Maybe not have been so redundant.68,Neutral,Im not sure i did,I could be less specific69,Disagree,"I wanted to bring the information to each picture, less and less of the information but still some of it so the computer could still have it and gain a bit new information at the same time.","Probably use my hands for some things, otherwise I would explain in pretty much the same fashion."70,Strongly Disagree,I repeated the descriptors and information in each case. Repetition leads to learning.,nothing.71,Agree,Simply because I didn't think of them in time.,"Sat down for an hour or two to think about the best way to do this, and then *test.*"72,Strongly Disagree,Each concept was completely different and needed completely different instructions to identify the concept.,"I would have been less specific, because a human should know what the objects are that they are looking at rather a computer may not know."73,Agree,I felt I already explained certain examples to the computer.,I would tell the person thoroughly what those concepts are and what they are used for.74,Strongly Disagree,I just repeated most info because i thought you wanted complete answers for each,I would have asked if they understood.. Asked for feedback so I could explain further if needed75,Agree,"I revisited some explanations when they were presented differently and tried to go into detail, but some of the concepts were obvious and seemed like they would have been presented twice in slightly different ways during the same example.","I would show a human certain motions and describe how certain textures felt. I would probably use more comparisons since I could ask a human if they were familiar with certain concepts. I would probably use hand motions to describe shapes, how things are held, and angles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
