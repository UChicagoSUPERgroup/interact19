Every car has to stop when they approch this They have stop signs on 4 corners.,Yes,The yellow boxes are pedestrian walk signals. Anytime these are present there is a crossroad next to them.,Yes,It is a 4 way intersection so there are multiple crossroads. Every direction can cross into one of the 3 on the crossroad.,Agree,I clearly described the markings that would indicate a crosswalk,Agree,I demonstrated how people or transit are crossing the other paths,nothing that i can think of,,3,Yes,"You see the meeting of two streets in a + shape formation. The photograph does not show the full + shape; nevertheless, it is clear that the photograph is taken at the perpendicular meeting of two streets",No,"This image shows the junction of two separate train tracks, but no intersection of tracks and no distinctive + shape. Without the intersection it cannot be called a crossroad.",Yes,"You will see the intersection of two roads. Generally the roads will intersect perpendicularly, so that the resulting shape as seen from the sky looks like this: +. This + shape formed by the intersection of two roads is the surest sign of a crossroad.",No,"What you see here is the symbolic representation of a crossroad as indicated by the street signs, Broadway and Spring St. The photograph is taken on the corner of B'way and Spring. But you do not see the road itself, and therefore this cannot be called a crossroad.",Yes,"Here you see both the actual crossroad and the representation of the crossroad by the street signs. The two roads meet perpendicularly to form a + shape from above. Both streets are visible, as is their intersection.",Agree,I think I've outlined at least one major principle of the crossroad.,Agree,"I think I taught one important principle of the crossroad, and taught the computer to recognize that when it appears.","I might need to teach about crossroads from certain odd angles, and odd types of crossroad.",,4,Yes,There are roads that intersect at a 90 degree angle. Another indication that there is a crossroad is the stop sign in the image.,No,"This image has lines in the form of lines, but they do not intersect. Merging lines are indicative of a fork, but not a crossroad. A crossroad usually occurs where lines are perpendicular.",Yes,"In this image there are two roads that meet at a 90 degree angle. This is a sign that there is a crossroad. There is not a traffic light here, however there is a stop sign. Stop signs are often present when there is a crossroad.",Yes,"In this image, there are street signs that indicate a crossroad. The signs for the streets are perpendicular to one another. This is a type of crossroad. There are lines that intersect.",Yes,"Crossroad often refers to the point at which two lines meet. In this image, there are to roads that cross each other. A crossroad often has traffic signals nearby as this image does.",Neutral,I gave tangible indicators of a crossroad. Perpendicular lines are a good indication.,Neutral,"Similar to above. Looking for stop signs, traffic lights, and perpendicular lines are a helpful cue.",This task would probably require a lot more examples for the computer to train on.,,5,Yes,"There is a stop signal, and this always means that you must completely stop your vehicle and let other car pass and pass when the road is free or when it becomes your turn.",Yes,"There is a crossroad, but it's not for vehicles, it's just for train. You can see the crossroad in the upper, center part of the picture, where the railways cross each other to allow the train to move from a railway to another.",Yes,"There is a stop signal, and as we saw in the first picture of the series, it always means that a vehicle must stops and allow other vehicles to pass (or pass when it will be its turn)",Yes,"The crossroad isn't visible, but we understand from the street signs that there is a crossroad between Spring Street and Broadway.",Yes,"There are red lights, and they always mean that there is a crossroad in which some car are stopped by the lights while some other are allowed to pass and vice versa,",Strongly Agree,I gave the computer some hints from which it will be able to understand when there is a crossroad,Agree,"There is the case of a crossroad without signals that hasn't been contemplated, but the computer should be able to understand that there is a crossroad from the signs with the names of the streets, from the stop signals, and from the red lights.","As I said, there is the case of low traffic crossroads in which there are no signals, it would have been useful to add a picture of one of these streets as well.",,6,Yes,Roads running in perpendicular lines cross here.,Yes,"A crossroad is the intersection of two roads. In the image above, it's a rail line, but they do intersect. In other words, one crosses over another.",Yes,"There are two streets in the image, meeting at an intersection, and crossing over each other.",Yes,"Although you can't see the road itself in the image above, you can see the signs for the streets below. The signs clearly show that Broadway and Spring street meet here, and cross over each other.",Yes,Two paved roads meet at a 90 degree angle and continue on.,Agree,The basic concepts regarding what a crossroad is have been covered.,Agree,I believe the information given is sufficient the computer will be able to tell for itself in the future.,I can't think of anything relevant that hasn't been covered.,,7,Yes,there are 4 roads crossing each other which makes them a crosses roads,No,roads are something a car uses the image is that of a railroad car which uses tracks.,Yes,4 roads are meeting at a point and intersect.,No,there is just a picture of a bunch of signs there is no road so to speak in the picture,Yes,above are the roads that seem to be crossing at a certain point making them a crosroads,Agree,i gave a defination on what crossroads are,Agree,i used what people use to tell what crosroads are,no to tell from signs if a road is a crossroads,,8,Yes,Two streets intersect on the left side of the photo. A crosswalk is on the right side. The road is paved and stop signs are visible for vehicles traveling forward in the picture.,No,The photo shows parallel train tracks joining. A switch on the track is near the middle top of the photo. A train is visible on the right most track. This is not a crossroad. Crossroads are intersections of streets.,Yes,The photo shows a four way stop intersection. Each street has one lane of traffic in each direction. The intersection is a crossroad.,Yes,This is a sign showing that the corner is an intersection of Broadway and Spring St. The two streets cross at that point so it is a crossroad.,Yes,"The signs are not visible, but two intersecting streets are visible. There are lights on all four directions showing when to stop or go. The streets appear to continue far out of the point where the photo was taken.",Strongly Agree,These pictures were easier to classify. I defined a crossroad as the intersection of streets going in different directions. I pointed out that the streets continue out of frame and how street signs can indicate that streets are present. I also showed how to exclude parallel train tracks from the concept of crossroads.,Neutral,"There may be some similar photos where the rules work, but different conditions like unpaved streets and angles which cut off part of the picture might not be picked up as a crossroad.",More training data showing different types of crossroads would help. Geo tags and maps of the area might help with certainty since a photo of a sign might exclude the street median that stops through traffic.,,9,Yes,It clearly shows a road crossing another road. That is the definition of a crossroad.,No,A cross road is two roads crossing and this does not show roads at all. It shows only railroad tracks.,Yes,This shows more than one road crossing the other. A crossroad is a road that crosses another road and that is shown here clearly.,Yes,This shows signs going in two different directions so this indicates two crossing roads which is the definition of a crossroad.,Yes,This shows a road crossing another road which is the definition of a crossroad.,Strongly Agree,I gave a clear definition,Strongly Agree,I gave a clear definition of a crossroad.,I don't think there is anything else to add to it - it is a straight forward explanation of what a crossroads is.,,10,Yes,two roads are crossing each other. There is a choice of which direction to go in. the stop sign indicats the intersection of two roads,No,This is an image of train tracks not a road,Yes,There are two different roads that cross each other forming an intersection. When at the intersection a person has a choice of directions to go in.,Yes,The signs on the pole indicates that there is a side street branching off of the main street,Yes,There are two roads intersecting. drivers have a choice of which direction to go in. Traffic lights indicate the intersection of two roads,Strongly Agree,I was able to give the computer things that would indicate a crossroad,Strongly Agree,I was able to show what did and did not indicate a crossroad,more examples of what is not a crossroad,,11,Yes,the stop sigh in the middle of the road indicates that there are four roads instead of just the three roads intersecting.,No,there are only two roads merging into each other.,Yes,four different roads intersecting with road signs,Unsure,"I have no idea because I can't see the streets, plus there are one way streets for two.",Yes,there are four roads intersecting with each other. there are four lights and four street signs.,Agree,"yes, I think I did an okay job.",Agree,I'm not sure if five examples is enough data for them to generalize,no other information,,12,Yes,"The image shows a street going straight ahead and another street going to the left and right. So, the streets cross each other, making a crossroad.",No,The train tracks are not roadways.,Yes,"Two streets in the image are perpendicular to each other, so they are crossing each other.",Yes,"Though we cannot actually see the roads intersecting, the signs indict that two streets are crossing each other at this point.",Yes,The street lights and signs indict that there are two streets crossing each other here.,Agree,The computer should be able to distinguish two streets intersect each other.,Agree,"The indicators of lights, signs, and intersecting streets are all common of any crossroad.",Perhaps that crossroads are streets intersecting on land.,,13,Yes,These roads cross each other in this picture. This picture has a stop sign signalling traffic to stop.,No,These trains tracks do not cross one another. They are close to each other but they do not cross.,Yes,This is an intersection of two different roads. They cross each other forming a crossroad. They also have a stop sign.,Yes,This street sign signals the name of the two streets that are crossing one another. Spring goes ones way and Broadway goes another. They form an X as they cross each other.,Yes,Crossroads in this picture is where the two roads cross each other. Forming and X with the two roads. Crossroads usually have stoplights or stop signs as well.,Strongly Agree,"If the computer looks for roads that cross, then I think they will be able to identify a crossroad.",Strongly Agree,"Looking for roads that cross, and have stop signs or stop lights, they should be able to identify them in the future.",Nothing more to add.,,14,Yes,"This photo shows an intersection of two streets, a.k.a. a crossroad. There are no street lights, but the stop sign on either side of the east-west street and the crosswalks are evidence that these streets fully intersect.",No,"The photo shows what looks to be a train yard, with no roads in sight. There is one small section of track that crosses over, but since it is not a road, it doesn't meet the definition of ""crossroad.""",Yes,"The photo shows an intersection of two roads, the definition of a crossroads. Some of the signs are difficult to see, but there are four stop signs, making this a four-way stop.",Yes,"While the roads themselves are not in the photo, the street signs indicate there is an intersection of two streets. Despite both being one-way streets, it still counts as a crossroad because one crosses the other.",Yes,"This is a photo of two roads intersecting, the very definition of ""crossroad."" Even though it's dark, it's easy to see there are traffic lights for each direction.",Strongly Agree,"I provided evidence for the existence of a crossroad, with clues such as four-way street lights and stop signs.",Agree,I feel I provided enough explanations and reasoning for future images to be identified.,"It may need further context and definition. For example, I'm unsure if two one-way streets across from each other emptying onto a two-way street counts as a crossroad.",,15,Yes,the road goes in multiple directions from one spot,No,There are no roads in this picture,Yes,From one spot the road goes in multiple directions,No,there are no roads in this picture,Yes,from one spot the road goes in multiple directions,Disagree,we use different languages are are perception is biased by feelings,Disagree,we use different languages are are perception is biased by feelings and experiences,none,,16,Yes,This is a place where two roads intersect.,No,this is a train merge where two tracks come together so it would not be a cross road.,Yes,This is another example of where two roads come together to form a plus symbol,No,I think that ther might be a crossroad in the picture below the sign but we can not see it. It is not visible.,Yes,This is a place where two roads come together and meet. one road it going one way and the other is perpendicular to the other one.,Agree,I think that it is really a simple thing to learn.,Agree,I think the examples of a cross read is straight forward.,I would like to see more merges and some more simple pictures. I would also like aerial photos to show,,17,Yes,There is one road going straight ahead after the stop sign where cars are parked on both sides. There is a crosswalk to the right and then another road that is perpendicular to the road that goes straight ahead.,Yes,"At the top of the picture, there is a railroad track with two parallel tracks. There is also an X in the train tracks where the trains can switch tracks.",Yes,There is a stop sign with one road going in that direction. There is another road that starts in the bottom left of the picture and goes the upper right of the picture.,Yes,There are two street signs : Broadway and Spring street that are perpendicular to each other. There are also one way signs up above the street signs that show that there are two streets crossing each other. Below the street signs there are crosswalk signs that are facing the other direction. There are two of them again perpendicular to each other showing that there are two roads crossing.,Yes,There are cars that facing where the picture is being taken that is one road. You can see that another road is crossing it as it goes from the middle left to the bottom right of the picture. There are also traffic lights going in two directions. The green ones for the oncoming traffic and the red ones to the left that let cars know to stop.,Agree,I think I did okay but could have given a little more detail in a few of the pictures.,Agree,I feel for the most part that I did give a decent amount of detail but it could be better.,I did not mention color of the road or the sky vs road. I'm sure with more thought I would come up with a little more description.,,18,Yes,"Although I can't see much of the crossroad in the foreground, I can see the stop sign and ""stop"" written on the ground, which is what one would expect where two roads cross.",No,"This shows a train, which runs on tracks. Crossroads are made up of roads for wheeled vehicles or pedestrians, not trains.",Yes,There are two roads that meet at a square angle.,No,"There are street signs in the picture, but no roads, so this cannot show a crossroad.",Yes,"Although only a bit of on of the roads is visible, the presence of traffic lights makes me think this is a crossroads.",Disagree,Street scenes can be very complicated. I feel it's unlikely that even similar images could all be identified.,Strongly Disagree,"Some crossroads have signs, some don't. Some roads are well demarcated, some aren't. I feel correctly identifying every variation is unlikely.","Crossroads may not always come together at a square angle. They may not have stop signs or lights.",,19,Yes,sections or roads that cross each other.,Yes,looking for an x on the rail. where two lanes cross.,Yes,stop signs at corners and different streets.,No,"these are just street signs, not a cross road. it may be below.",Yes,can see the crossing streets and intersections.,Agree,provided examples from pictures and images.,Agree,Identified what was not a crossroad,nothing,,20,Yes,There is a road in the image. This is where two roads meet and cross each other.,No,The main object of the image is not a road. This is a railway. There are not crossroads.,Yes,There are roads in the image. The two roads meet and cross each other. There is a stop sign. There are usually stops signs or traffic lights at a crossroad.,No,This image does not show any roads at all. For the image to have a crossroad there must be roads in the image.,Yes,"In the image, two roads meet and cross each other. There is a traffic light which is a way to control traffic at a cross road.",Strongly Agree,I have taught the computer the basic concepts.,Agree,The computer now knows how to identify crossroads. It doesn't take much.,The roads are sometimes not paved.,,21,Yes,"There is an intersection that you can cross safety so yea. I think that the crossroad is where people are allowed to walk, but I am not sure.",Unsure,"If a crossroad is like a railroad track then yea. I am not sure if a crossroad means an intersection, or a railroad so it is hard to say whether or not it is in the picture.",Unsure,"I think a crossroad is like an intersection. So if that is correct, then yea this is probably a crossroad I assume.",Unsure,"There is no picture of the road itself so it is impossible to tell. The signs may indicate there is one, but you cannot be sure unless you can actually see it.",Unsure,It simply looks like an intersection. I don't see any area of the road where people are allowed to cross. If there was one of these areas then it would be a crossroad.,Disagree,Crossword is another vague term.,Disagree,I honestly don't even know what a crossroad is to be honest.,"I would first find the definition of what they mean by crossroad, and tell the system exactly that.",,22,Yes,"We are viewing the picture as a pedestrian might view the scene. There is a crossroads right in front of us, we can keep moving straight, or decide to go left or right.",No,Train tracks are NOT roads. They do not allow for the same behavior from a train that roads do for a car. A train cannot have a crossroads.,Yes,There are two roads and they meet each other. If you were on one road and came across the crossing then you would have come to a crossroads. Two roads meeting each other and both continuing.,No,"There is evidence of a crossroads here. The street signs suggest that there is a crossroads and in some cases the signs would be enough, but if asked i would say there is not a crossroads in this picture.",Yes,"There are two roads that meet and both continue, that is what a crossroads is.",Agree,because it's not hard and i gave concrete definitions of what i think a crossroads is.,Disagree,"There will likely be a case where my definition doesn't suffice, either because of image quality or viewing angle. I can imagine the computer getting confused still.","nothing really, maybe i should have been more lenient on the roadsigns picture though.",,23,Yes,There are white lines on the pavement. There is a stop sign. There are vehicles parked on the road. This looks like an intersection of roads.,Unsure,There is a train on train tracks. There is pavement but it may pass under the train tracks. There is no visible traffic signal or stop sign.,Yes,There are roads. There is pavement. There is a stop sign. There are white lines on the pavement. There are vehicles parked on the pavement. The vehicles are going in different directions.,Unsure,You cannot see pavement. There is no road visible. There are street signs. There are buildings.,Yes,There are roads. There is pavement. There is a traffic signal. There are vehicles on the road. A traffic signal means there is traffic coming from a different direction needing to be controlled.,Agree,"I have listed road, pavement and traffic signals or stop sign as indicators of crossroads.",Disagree,"Future images may have other road situations that need further descriptions, such as roads that are not paved and have no signs or signals.",How to tell if there are two roads that intersect without traffic control or pavement.,,24,Yes,The stop sign indicates a road that is intersected by another street running perpendicular,No,There is no street or intersection of streets to create a crossroad.,Yes,There are four rounded corners of land pointing to the same area of the street. There are areas of street running in all four directions from the center.,No,"There is no street or road or other thoroughfare in this image. Although the street signs indicate that a crossroad does exist, it isn't visible in the image.",Yes,There is a traffic light regulating flow in at least two directions from the point where pavement meets.,Neutral,"I might have helped a little, but I couldn't be sure unless the computer was tested on it.",Disagree,I'm not sure it was thorough enough for a computer to learn.,not sure,,25,Yes,a road that intersects another road is a crossroad. It generally has 4 directions of possible travel.,No,"although the railways move away from each other, it is not possible to jump from one track to the other in opposite directions.",Yes,a road that intersects another road is a crossroad. It generally has 4 directions of possible travel. this is seen in the above photo.,Unsure,though the actual view of the streets or roads are not visible the signs indicating a intersection are present indicating it could possibly be a crossroads with 4 directions of travel.,Yes,a road that intersects another road is a crossroad. It generally has 4 directions of possible travel.,Agree,I explained what an intersection entails,Agree,I explained what constitues an intersection,nothing,,26,Yes,"This is a crossroad because two roads intersect with each other, they cross and then move on into different directions.",No,"this is not a crossroad because while there are two roads close to each other, they did not cross paths and thus do not count. The paths must physically intersect or join together in opposing directions.",Yes,This is a crossroads because two roads go through each other and then go on to go in different directions.,Yes,There is a crossroads in this picture because multiple roads go in opposite directions crossing each other. This time you can't see the roads themselves but the signs are enough to go off of. The signs pointing in different directions indicate that those are roads,Yes,"This is a crossroad because there are many street signs and because there are two roads going in opposite directions that cross pathways, that diverge into different directions.",Strongly Agree,I covered every possible angle I could here. there is nothing i left out,Strongly Agree,i think i drilled the concept enough for it to get it,I can't think of anything I missed although I'm sure there are some minor details,,27,Yes,"There is a stop sign, the lines in the street to show where the pedestrians will cross at to get to the other side.",No,This is an elevated train track. Not any area for people to walk on or cross at. It is just a picture of a train going on the tracks.,Yes,It is a street intersection that has 4 corners and stop signs. These are things you find in a crossroad. The sidewalks too for people to walk on and cross over to.,No,This is a picture of a street sign and an apartment building in the backround. It is possible that it was taken in a crossroad but it is just a street sign on a corner where two streets meet.,Yes,This is a crossroad because it is an intersection. You can see the lines for people to cross at.,Strongly Agree,I gave good examples of what to look for and what defines a crossroad.,Strongly Agree,My examples were good and detailed. The computer should know what to look for in the image.,"Nothing,i feel like my examples were pretty good.",,28,Yes,There are two roads connecting in a perpendicular fashion. A crossroad is when two roads intersect. A cross road also has a stop sign at the intersecting spot.,Yes,In the distance of the picture two railroads cross each other at about a 90 degree angle and continue on.,Yes,There are two intersecting roads in this picture. A stop sign is at the intersection. It is clearly seen that there is two roads crossing each other.,Yes,The sign post has two streets. The two one-way signs determine that the roads cross at a 90 degree angle.,Yes,There are 3 sets of lights. The red lights indicate that traffic should stop from one of the roads. The green signs say that there are two roads. They cross at a 90 degree angle.,Agree,I think I was able to provide enough of an explanation to determine whether similar images are also crossroads.,Neutral,It is difficult to tell whether a computer would be able to use my information to determine the concept of crossroads in any picture. I am not confident that I explained well enough.,A crossroads is always two or more roads that intersect.,,29,Yes,One street crosses another street and there is a stop sign for traffic not to enter the street because cars could be driving in a different direction.,No,There is not a street that crosses over another street and these are trains and not cars.,Yes,One street crosses over another street and there is a stop sign to stop traffic from entering the street when cars are moving in another direction.,Yes,There is a street sign with the names of different streets which indicate that the sign is on the corner of two different streets.,Yes,One street crosses over another street and there is a traffic light to stop cars from entering into the cross section when cars are traveling in another direction.,Agree,I taught some of the attributes necessary to indicate a crossroad.,Agree,It will know to look for these attributes in the images in the future to indicate a crossroad.,Nothing I can think of.,,30,Yes,"There is a street that goes left to right, and a street that goes into the picture, behind the stop sign. A street sign facing a different way than the street also implies that there is a crossroad.",No,"The rails do not cross, but rather meets and merges, or one runs above one another. It's not crossing because there are only 3 way directions where the rails are going, rather than 4.",Yes,"There is a street going bottom left to top right of the picture, and another street that goes from bottom right to top left. There is four curved corners of the sidewalk in the picture, which implies a crossroad.",Yes,The street signs imply that there are two streets crossing under it. The signs are facing different ways. The lights in the yellow boxes for the pedestrians are facing different directions too.,Yes,"There are street signs that are facing different directions, which imply a crossroad. The street lights and signals are facing different directions too.",Agree,"If there are street signs or lights in the picture, I think the computer can tell if there is a crossroad. I'm not sure how well a computer can tell which directions the streets are going without signs.",Agree,"As long as it can differentiate streets from other background images, I think it can tell if there are different directions of the streets in the picture. I think it can tell street signs and the way it's facing too.","If the road is crowded with cars or people, I'm not sure if it can tell that it is a road.",,31,Yes,"I believe this is a crossroad because there is a stop sight which tells cars to stop and check both left and right directions to see if traffic is coming. Just light a stop light, a stop sign indicates that there is traffic going across the path of the oncoming traffic. I can also see a road laying perpendicular to the direction the camera is facing.",No,"While there is more than one path here, neither of them intersect each other. The run alongside one another so, by definition, they are not a crossroad. To be a crossroad they would have to cross one another.",Yes,"There are two roads which cross one another, so it is a crossroad. By definition, the two roads intersect one another. You can also tell by the stop sign which indicates that one roads traffic needs to stop to make sure that crossing traffic doesn't crash into it. The stop sign tells each side to wait and take turns going while one side waits.",No,"There are no roads at all within view of the photo. While there are road signs that indicate there may be a crossroad, we can't see it in the photo. In order to say for certain that there is a crossroad, one would have to see that there were roads and that they intersected each other. The sings don't mean for sure that there is a crossroad because sometimes street signs just mark a part of the landscape that isn't really a road.",Yes,"I can tell that there is a crossroad here because there are two roads that intersect each other. I can see that there are two roads making an a cross shape if looked at from above. Even though it's dark, I looked at the street lights which tell me that there is one road with a green light crossing another with a red light.",Agree,I defined what a crossroad is. In each picture I tried to repeat the definition and illustrate why the parts of the photo fit that definition. In the photos without crossroads I explained why they weren't there.,Agree,I think future images can be compared to the definition and to the clues I gave.,I think that's pretty much it. Maybe another way to define the crossroad would be also to say that there have to be two roads which are not perpendicular in addition to crossing each other at some point.,,32,Yes,Two streets are intersecting and cross paths. A stop sign is present to help with the flow of traffic.,No,The railways do not contradict each other and the flow of traffic is not in conflict of each other.,Yes,There are two streets that intersect that run into each other. A stop sign is needed to direct the flow of traffic.,Yes,There is a street sign that states there are two roads that are intersecting and that cross paths here.,Yes,There are two streets that intersect. A stop light is needed to control traffic. There are also street signs pointed in opposite directions.,Agree,I said that the roads have too intersect and traffic needs to be controlled.,Agree,I said that the roads have too intersect and traffic needs to be controlled.,none,,33,Yes,"there is a cross walk and even though you can't really see the full intersection, you know it is there.",No,this is a railway system.,Yes,shows an intersection and streets crossing. There are stop signs so cars know to stop and pedestrians can cross easily,Unsure,the picture is showing the signs for the crossroad but you can not exactly see the roads you will cross.,Yes,you see the intersection and parts you can see the crosswalk.,Agree,"i mentioned what to look for, signs, intersections, crosswalks.",Neutral,i taught what to look for in a crosswalk but perhaps it needs more information.,"maybe showing it more images, for example you can have a cross walk in the middle of a single road and that is not the same as crossroads. So i can see a computer getting confused",,34,Yes,The photo shows a road that crosses another road. The paths of travel are in different directions.,No,This image is not showing a crossroad. I does not show two roads crossing each other.,Yes,There are two roads that cross each other. The roads travel in different directions.,Yes,There are street signs perpendicular to each other and this indicates a place at which two streets cross each other.,Yes,There are two streets that cross each other. It is hard to see the road because of the lighting but the street signs confirm that there are two streets crossing each other.,Neutral,I am hesitant to imagine five examples are enough to teach a computer the nuances of noticing crossroads.,Neutral,Crossroads can be hard to identify and any future image is a lot to imagine it is capable of.,"A crossroad can be a road that joins two other main roads. A crossroads can be an intersection of more than two roads.  A crossroad can also be a point of important decision which would be harder to see in photos.",,35,Yes,"The stop signs on either side of the street are a indication that the intersection is a crossroads you can after a stop choose to go straight, right or left depending on your destination.",Yes,This is a train crossroads and you can tell by the x crossroad towards the back of the picture it allows trains to change their direction and go on a different set of tracks than they originally started off with.,Yes,The stop signs once again signify a crossroads where you have multiple directions that you can head after making the stop at the sign. While there are no street signs a stop sign is a good indicator of a crossroads.,Yes,The two street signs show to different streets which lets you know that this is a crossing or a crossroads.,Yes,The traffic signals and the green street signs above them is another indicator of a crossroads the traffic signals direct the flow of traffic so that you can decide safely in busier intersections what direction you need to head in.,Strongly Agree,I thoughly described what made the different pictures indicators of a crossroad.,Strongly Agree,I gave the computer enough clues of what to look for depending on the method of travel.,n/a,,36,Yes,There are four entryways that intersect in one area.,No,These are train tracks. Crossroads have to be on the street. There has to be 4 entryways or paths where they all intersect.,Yes,"There are 4 entryways for vehicles. It covers every way you can go or come from. The crossroad is the intersection between all four paths, where all the roads cross each other.",Unsure,It looks like more than 2 paths or streets are intersecting at one point.,Yes,This has four entryways for vehicles. The intersect at one point and all 4 roads connect here.,Agree,I gave definitive requirements of a crossroad,Agree,My requirements allow the computer to easily identify a crossroad.,None,,37,Yes,one road that crosses another as in an intersection were 2 roads come together at one point.,No,"there are no intersecting roads here, no 2 roads coming together shown.",Yes,"there are 2 roads that come to an intersection, where both roads meet, they cross each other.",No,"there are no roads shown here so there are no roads intersection...however there are signs that signify that there are crossroads, but the roads are not shown",Yes,an intersection of 2 roads that cross each other.,Agree,i explained specifically what the aspects of crossroads are and look like,Agree,i explained specifically what the aspects of crossroads are and look like,none,,38,Yes,There are two roads that cross each other in the middle. There are stop signs in the photo. The stop signs are opposite one another. There is a road that crosses between the two stop signs.,No,This photo is of train tracks. Trains are not considered to travel on crossroads. There are no streets in the photo. There is no streets crossing one another.

Each stop sign is facing opposite of one another. There is a road that crosses between the opposite facing stop signs.,Yes,There are signs in the photo. Each sign on the post in the photo are facing a different direction. There are signs that say one way. The one way signs are pointing in different directions.,Yes,There are roads in the photo. The roads make a cross in the middle. There are traffic lights in the photo. The traffic lights are on all four sides of the road.,Strongly Agree,I feel that I have given the computer enough information to distinguish between whether a photo contains a crossword or not based upon streets being in the photo and whether those streets cross one another or not.,Strongly Agree,"Every image that has crossroads contains a road. If there are traffic lights opposite one another or stop signs opposite one another, and a road crosses between them, then the computer should automatically know that it is a crossroad.",I don't believe anything additional can be taught to the computer. The computer should be able to distinguish between crossroads.,,39,Yes,"This image shows two different streets. they are crossing over one another,in an intersections, so there is a crossroads here. Actually, there are several,because there are several different ways use can go. However, this is still a crossroads.",Yes,"A crossroad is two intersecting paths. It can also be metaphorical-when a person comes to two paths and must choose. This picture shows a train coming across two different tracks,and it must choose which one.",Yes,"This is a crossroads. There are two different streets clearly intersecting one another. You can go any of the ways,or cross over to another street.",Yes,"This shows two streets intersecting-Broadway and Spring St. These two roads cross over one another, as shown by the sign stating that there is a corner where they cross there. So they are a crossroads. Generally, if there are two street signs in a cross, you can tell the two streets cross.",Yes,"Although you can't tell what the signs say, it is obvious that there are several streets intersecting. You can further tell this by the direction of the cars-they are coming one way, but in the distance,they are going another. Because there are mutliple options and multiple roads, this is indeed a crossroads.",Strongly Agree,"Every image showed a crossroad. Also, the concept was easier than I realized, since it is just two streets crossing one another.",Strongly Agree,"If the only rule is two streets crossing, then I think the computer can easily learn that.","Honestly, railroad tracks might still be hard. And metaphorical crossroads might also be strange to it.",,40,Yes,"yes, one street is intersecting the other on the same level. this is a good example of a cross road. other vehicles, cars, or pedestrians could cross or impede your path as you travel down the street.",No,"there is no crossroad pictured here at all. the predominant feature are the rails. they might cross a road, but it wouldn't be a cross road because they aren't on the same level as the streets. for it to be considered a cross road, the intersection must happen at the same horizontal level.",Yes,there is an intersection point where one road crosses another. there is a road that runs through/across another road. cars people or other vehicles can go across your path as you travel down the road you are on.,No,"technically no. there is no crossroad pictured. the street signs are pictured. you might be at crossroad, but none is specifically visible from this perspective.",Yes,"its not a well lit example, but it fits the description. there is a point where two roads intersect on the same level, cars vehicles are people could cross the path of travellers down either of the roads.",Agree,I think there was enough examples and explanations to adequately describe a crossroad. Maybe a few more examples of what isn't a crossroad would help,Agree,"through the explanations, yes. I think it is relatively clear, however I don think a few more examples of what isn't a cross road would help contrast.","not sure. perhaps situations that only involve pedestrian paths, and not just roads for cars.",,41,Yes,Two roads coming and going in different directions converge together. The roads lead away and toward each other. The roads are flat.,No,These are train tracks and not roads. They are above the surrounding ground unlike roads. They carry trains and not cars or other types of traffic.,Yes,These roads converge after coming and going in different directions. They cross one another and lead in different directions.

They are long and narrow.,Unsure,"The signs indicate a crossroad but the roads themselves are not shown, which would make it more difficult to explain. The signs could create confusion in identifying crossroads.",Yes,Two roads coming and going in different directions are visible. They are flat and carry traffic/cars. They are designed to move traffic on the ground.,Disagree,"It was difficult describing a road other than flat and conveying traffic, a description a computer could likely not understand.",Disagree,The descriptions were not thorough enough to identify what a crossroad looks like.,I could have mentioned angles on the road as being perpendicular to one another.,,42,Yes,This could be considered a crossroad because the two roads intersect each other.,No,"A crossroad means that two images have to cross each other. Like a t or a + they have to intersect. These roads just split, they do not cross.",Yes,This is clearly a crossroad because you can see that it looks like a plus symbol +.

This is a spot where trains come together.,Yes,This is a crossroad. Two streets intersect or cross making it a crossroad.,Yes,"This is a crossroad. Even though the intersecting streets cannot be seen, the two street signs ""Broadway"" and ""Spring St"" also represent the intersecting or crossing of two streets.",Yes,This is a crossroad. A crossroad is a point where two streets intersect.,Strongly Agree,A crossroad is something that is tangible and observable.,Strongly Agree,If the computer should easily be able to determine whether or not two streets cross.,Nothing,,50,Yes,I saw a street that led into another street at a perpendicular angle. One street opens into another street.,No,"I don't see one street running into another street at a perpendicular angle. Instead, I see railroad tracks.",Yes,One street crosses another street. This is a crossroad.,Yes,I saw a lamppost and saw two street signs at 90-degree angles.,Yes,"One street crosses another street. Also, there is a traffic light.",Agree,There was little ambiguity in the photos. So I was able to describe them better.,Agree,There was little ambiguity in the photos. So I was able to describe them better than eating photos.,Maybe technical details used by traffic engineers?,,51,Yes,"I can tell there are two roads crossing one another creating a crossroad. the two roads on the left and right of the image disappear but they assuredly continue on. The viewpoint we are in tells me we are coming from a road, also the stop sign facing us. and we can clearly see the road in front for some distance.",No,These are not roads they are railroad tracks. I know this because I can see the rectangle shapes of trains that are on road-like tracks made of many planks of wood with steel silver rails on top,Yes,the straight lines that become rounded then turn in a 45 degree angle are sidewalk corners. They are built along side many roads. The dark surface is the road and we can see 3 roads very carefully. The fourth part of the crossroad which comes from the left bottom corner to the right side of the image disappears but cars park along side many roads and we can see they go downwards because of the hill. The street also go down and onward.,Yes,Without seeing the roads I know that these rectangles with lettering on them are street signs. They represent the roads. The lettering is the name of the roads and the ones with arrows tell the direction of traffic. Also the building in the image almost always are built along side roads.,Yes,the direction the red and green lights are facing tells me roads go on even out of the image. also the round whitish lights are on cars.

This shows that the roads cross each other.,Yes,"Although it's dark, you can see the street signs at the top showing that it is two different streets crossing each other. That means that it is a crossroad.",Agree,I explained about streets/roads crossing each other at an intersection.,Neutral,I can not say if the computer will be able to recognize it from any image.,I'm not sure.,,53,Yes,There is a stop sign in the picture. The road branches into multiple directions. There is a crosswalk. The crosswalk is indicated by the white lines connecting the sidewalks.,Unsure,The road is not very visible in the picture.

There are sidewalks along the four directions of the road.,Unsure,"There are street signs in the picture and lights. However, you cannot see the road.",Yes,The road branches into four directions. There are traffic lights in all four directions. There are white lines across the roads connecting the sidewalks.,Neutral,I gave the computer as many objects to look for that signify there is a crosswalk. I could have been more specific about there placement.,Neutral,The computer may have enough variables to look for in order to make a good guess.,"I need to teach the computer about sidewalks, lines on the road, and street signs and lights.",,54,Yes,You can see the roads going in different directions. The stop would control traffic for oncoming traffic.,No,This is not a crossroad. It is many railroad tracks but they are going over and under each other. The tracks never form an intersection therefore there is no crossroad.,Yes,"There is a 4 way intersection with stop signs on each corner. The crossroads have 4 directions in which traffic can travel. East, West, North and South.",No,There is not an actual view of the crossroad. The photo is of the street signs and traffic lights but the photo is taken at an angle were you see the buildings on the street but not the crossroad.,Yes,You can tell it is a crossroad because of the traffic lights. You would only need the traffic lights at a crossroad and also the street signs represent another road running perpendicular to the main street.,Disagree,I had a hard time putting a crossroad into terms.,Agree,I talked about what is need to form a crossroad.,I talked about the fact you might have the components for a crossroad but if the camera angle is wrong you would be able to see the intersection.,,55,Yes,"Three roads join together with a stop sign present, indicating it's a crossroads where these roads meet. they connect directly onto each other.",No,"A crossroad would be where two roads meet each other.

The indication for the traffic as two ways as shown by the parking of the vechicles on both sides of the street.,Yes,"The train tracks to intersect and the train must be timed and directed which track to take and when. In the picture there is a big ""X"" when the trains cross over the tracks. Four rails are visible as well. The tracks are designated only for trains. A train is a vehicle and they travel on tracks. Yes there is a crossroad for the train.",Yes,This is a crossroad as there are two streets at the intersection. There is STOP written at the intersection on the four way. There are two actual STOP signs that are visible. Traffic is a two way street as there are cars parked on both sides pointing in opposite ways.,Yes,It is a one way crossroad because there are four signs that give direction. The street names are Broadway and Spring Street. The two one way signs allow the drivers to see which way they can travel. Both Broadway and Spring Street can only travel the way the one way sign is pointing for them. The top one way sign is designated for Spring Street. The second one way sign is designated for Broadway.,Yes,This is a crossroad as indicated by the signs that are hung as well as traffic lights that designate when drivers are to stop and go. There is a cross walk that is visible that allows pedestrians to cross. Each street is a two way as indicated by the cars on one side of the road.,Strongly Agree,Because I indicated the way of the streets and showed whether it was one way or two ways. I indicated the crossings and lights if there were any. I indicated signs and markers.,Agree,I did my best to described the intersections as well as indicated of where vehicles travel. I named the streets if they were readable and the signs that signal a crossings.,Crossroads are intersections that vehicles travel on that there has to be made a decision of when to go or a time to go.,,58,Yes,"There are two roads that intersect and one crosses over the other, thus there is a crossroad in this image.",No,"There is not intersection or crossing over of two different roads in this image. There is a point of merging, but that is different than a crossroad.",Yes,This image has a crossroad in it as there are two streets that cross each other. One is going straight while the other crosses over it. It is in a shape of a cross - thus a crossroad.,Yes,There is an intersection or crossroad of two streets in this image. The signs indicate two different streets going two different directions - thus a crossroad.,Yes,A crossroad is where one street or road intersects with another. This image clearly demonstrates two streets that cross each other.,Agree,I have taught the fundamentals of what constitutes a crossroad to the computer. There are basics that need to exist for a crossroad.,Strongly Agree,I have implicitly set out the rules for a crossroad for the computer and it should be easily able to identify them using the rules.,There are some rare occasions when crossroads are not in a perfect cross pattern and are slightly offset. This may cause slight confusion for the computer.,,59,Yes,it's right there.,Yes,it's right there.,Yes,it's right there.,Yes,Crossroads between two roads.,Yes,it's right there.,Neutral,i THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE TO ME.,Agree,i THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE TO ME.,na,,60,Yes,Two roads meet and intersect.,No,"Train tracks are crossing, but there are no roads intersecting.",Yes,Two roads meet and intersect. There is a stop sign. Stop signs are typically found when two or more roads meet.,Yes,"There are two street signs, Spring Street and Broadway, which shows the roads are intersecting.",Yes,Two roads are intersecting. There are traffic signals in different directions.,Agree,"I taught what to look for (traffic signals, stop signs, etc) when identifying the concept crossroads.",Agree,"I taught what to look for (traffic signals, stop signs, etc) when identifying the concept crossroads.",None,,61,Yes,This is a cross road. I can tell because the road is going if four different directions. There are traffic signals to control the traffic as to avoid a collision from the different directions of the road.,Yes,The crossroads are visible. I know this because the rails are spaced evenly and the track is very lond. I also see a locomotive on the tracks indicating further that it is a cross road.,Yes,Yes. It is clearly visible that the road goes if four different directions. It has traffic indicators to help avoid collisions. The markings on the cement are telling a driver to take a action or precaution.,Yes,It is because the street signs are indicating that there are two roads intersecting at that location. You can tell by the signs name and where they are located on the poll.,Yes,You can tell it is a crossroad by the street lights and the traffic. It can be seen that the road goes in four different directions. The lines in the street are also indicators to watch for.,Agree,"I tried to explain what to look for as far as street signs,markings on the pavement and traffic signals.",Agree,Because it is clearly for human traffic. I mentioned the basic ways to tell from certain characteristics that all crossroads share.,Nothing I can think of.,,62,Yes,"We can tell this is a crossroad because it passes our first test, when looking at the road itself we can make the cross shape. Next we can see that the streets both intersect and overlap each other. In this case we do not have traffic lights or street signs to go on, but we are able to tell it satisfies our other criteria.",No,"This is not a crossroad. I first looked for a cross made by the road or streets, but there is no cross and no roads or streets really. I looked for intersecting or overlapping roads and found none. Note that there is no bisection of these paths.",Yes,This is clearly a crossroad. First the cross shape can be made out by looking at the streets themselves. Next we can identify the intersection of the multiple roads as well as the fact that they overlap. We can see that these roads cross eachother,Yes,I looked at the area and determined if roads or signs to indicate the presence of a crossroad. I would normally pay attention to the actual roads and see if they cross. In this case we can look at the signs and they in fact do cross. This is a good indication of a crossroad which is an intersection of two streets.,Yes,"We can see clearly that this is a crossroad. Our first sign is the roads themselves, they form a cross shape when the picture is viewed in its entirety. You can clearly see that two roads intersect and overlap each other. We can also identify a crossroad by the traffic lights which are both across from each other and adjacent to each other.",Agree,I feel this way because I gave a clear guideline of steps that can be taken to identify a crossroad. Looking for each of the elements I instructed should allow the robot to make the correct determination.,Agree,I feel the computer should understand the concept of crossroad through the ways I described identifying one. I think the computer understands a crossroad is about intersecting and overlapping. This should allow them to carry the concept forward and apply it.,It might need more examples of crossroads with different signage or no signage so as not to rely on street lights as I mentioned in my instruction.,,63,Yes,"There is a stop sign, along with intersecting streets, which would indicate a crossroad.",No,"There are lots of train tracks, but no physical roads for cars or people to travel on, therefore no crossroad.",Yes,"Roads can be clearly seen, there is a stop sign and two intersecting streets. This is a crossroad.",No,"There are street signs that suggest a crossroad, and there probably is one, but there are no actual streets in the picture.",Yes,"There are two intersecting streets, along with stoplights. This is a crossroad.",Strongly Agree,"I explained what crossroads were, and what should be in the image to identify them.",Agree,"I feel like I explained what needed to be explained in the short amount of images I had. The one with the signs but no visible roads is the tricky one, because it's not a strictly yes or no answer.",How to determine if walkways or dirt paths are considered crossroads or not.,,64,Yes,there are two streets crossing over each other. Traffic comes from 4 directions,No,This picture does not contain a road. These are train tracks. Only cars travel on roads.,Yes,The roads cross each other. Cars come from 4 different directions.,No,There are no roads in this picture.,Yes,Two roads cross each other. Also there are traffic lights at many crossroads.,Agree,I felt there was enough information to identify,Agree,I explained what a crossroad is and what is not a crossroad,none,,65,Yes,"The area above is also a crossroad. More than one road intersects with each other. Also you will notice that there is a stop sign visible in the center of the crossroad. This is placed so that traffic will yield or stop to traffic that is currently passing from one side of the road to the other. If there was not crossroad, then a stop sign would probably not be needed.",No,The image above is of two rail road tracks coming together. This is very similar to a crossroad except that in the picture about they are not crossing over each other but instead are merging or coming together. A crossroad is a road that crosses another but does not merge with the road in the same direction.,Yes,"The picture above is of a crossroad. A crossroad is where any type of road meets and crosses past each other. This can also be called an intersection. A crossroad can be anywhere two roads or paths meet, but can also include more than two roads. A crossroad is only where you must pass through a another road to continue to your destination on the same road you currently are on.",Unsure,"The image above is kind of tricky in that the signs show that there is an intersection or crossroad, but the image itself does not show the road. By looking at the direction of the signs you can see that the road will cross over each other in the shape of an X.",Yes,"The image above is a crossroad. You will see that each section of the road has a stop light which is used to keep traffic from colliding while traffic on one road passes through the other road. You will also notice the shape that it makes while crossing is the shape of an X. If this was not a crossroad, then the stop lights would not need to be on a side of the roads.",Agree,I tried to explain the shape that a crossroad would make and how a crossroad functions. In the pictures that did not have a crossroad I explained what about them made them not cross. Also if the picture had it I explained why a stop sign or stop light was used and that they can often be indicators of a crossroad.,Agree,"I feel that I gave enough information about the shape, and reason for a crossroad that the computer should be able to identify them in most cases. I gave clues to look for when trying to identify one as well as an examples of why certain images were not one. I think the computer would be able to judge one pretty well now.",I didn't explain any other types of roads meeting that may not be a crossroad such as a side street or culdesac. I think in general most crossroads look similar so there shouldn't be too many cases where a road my meet but not cross.,,66,Yes,"First I checked to see if there was a road in the image, if there was a road I checked for a second road, then I checked to see if the second road crossed the first road. I could not tell if the second road crossed the first road or if it just ended at the first road.",No,"There is a road in the image, but there is not a second road crossing the first road. There is a train track going over the road, but I don't think that would count as a cross road.",Yes,I first checked to see if there was a road and if there was a second road too. Then I checked to see if the second road crossed the first road.,Unsure,"There is a street sign in the image, and it has two different street names on the sign, so its likely at a cross road, but you cannot actually see the road, just the sign.",Yes,"First I looked to see if there was a road visible. If there was one road, then I looked to see if there was a second road, then I checked to see if the second road crossed the first road.",Agree,"The computer should be able to identify if there is a road, and probably if there are two roads, but it might not be able to tell if they cross. It might have trouble telling the difference between a dead end road or a train track crossing the road.",Agree,"It should be able to tell if there is a road present in the image, then check for a second road crossing the first one and discard any images without roads.","That sometimes train tracks cross roads and sometimes roads end at a road, but do not cross them.",,67,Yes,"As a human, if I see a place where roads meet and intersect, I know it is a crossroad.",No,"As a human, I know that crossroads are 4 roads intersecting at one place. This is not what a crossroad looks like and also they do not have these for trains.",Yes,"As a human, if I see a place where roads meet and intersect, I know it is a crossroad.",No,"As a human, if I can not see the crossroad, I will assume that this does not meet the concept given.",Yes,"If I see two roads which intersect, then my human mind knows I am looking at a crossroad.",Neutral,"I feel I described crossroads well, but not as good as a person who drives.",Disagree,There were not a lot of images which were not meeting the crossroad concept,Crossroad signs,,68,Yes,there is more than one way to travel,No,trains do not use a crossroad,No,This shows that there is 4 ways to travel so its a crossroad,No,we cannot see the road so we dont know if there is a crossroad,Yes,There is more than one way to turn the car,Agree,i was accurate,Agree,I was objectie,none,,69,Yes,"I see a street going north to west judging by the stop sign. I can conclude judging by the crosswalk white painted lines that there is also a street going east to west, meeting in the middle. This includes a crossroad.",No,"Train tracks are moving parallel to eachother and not going from north to south and east to west with them all meeting in the middle, this picture would not contain a crossroad.",Yes,"You can see by the stop sign that there is a crossroad, north to south and east to west meeting in the middle. If there were no crossroad there would be no need for the stop sign.",Unsure,"I am unsure in this picture, I am unable to see the actual roadway. I can see the signs up above but that does not give me enough information to conclude it is a crossroad or not.",Yes,"I look to see if there is a road going north to south and then also east to west that meets in the middle, if that is the case then there is a crossroad.",Agree,"I would hope I explained myself well, but I can not be so sure, until I was able to see it in action, to know if it understood my teachings.",Agree,My explanations should help the computer in the future.,I think I covered everything.,,70,Yes,There is a crossroad in this image. There are two streets that intersect and cross each other.,No,"There is not crossroad in this image. There are two tracks that merge onto each other, however one does not cross the other.",Yes,A crossroad is a place where two roads cross each other. They intersect each other and form a cross-like appearance. There is a crossroad in this image.,Unsure,There is an implication of a crossroad in this image as there are two roads (streets) that intersect. However one cannot simply assume they are a crossroad without actually seeing it.,Yes,"There is a crossroad in this image. As defined, there are two streets that intersect and cross over each other. This is evident in this image.",Strongly Agree,I have clearly stated what defines a crossroad and the computer will be able to identify it.,Strongly Agree,I have set out the guidelines of the features of a crossroad and the computer will be able to recognize them in the future.,"If a crossroad happens to jut at an angle on one side, the computer may not be able to recognize it.",,71,Yes,There are two streets here which intersect: that is the definition of a crossroad.,No,"There are intermingled railroad tracks in this photo, but no crossroad. For there to be a crossroad, there must be roads that cross",Yes,"there is clearly a crossroad here. You see a street running from your right to your left, and crossing it--from the foreground on the left to the distance on your right--is another street. This is a crossroad.",Yes,"Because of all the signs and their placement (signs 90 degrees to each other in orientation), it seems there is a crossroad in this photo.",No,"Aside from the road lights in this photo, there is no definitive information that can tell you or I if there is a crossroad here.",Agree,I think I explained in some detail what defines a crossroad such that a robot could understand what a crossroad it.,Agree,For the reason cited in the above text box.,Noting that I can think of.,,72,Yes,This image has two roads that intersect with each other with a road sign in the middle.,Yes,This image shows a train track intersecting with another track. A train track and road are very similar. They can both represent a crossroad.,Yes,This image show two roads intersecting with each other. It has road signs at each road in the intersection.,No,The image needs to show a road intersecting with another road for identifying a crossroad. Commonly a sign showing different road names is present in the image.,Yes,This image show tree roads that intersect with each other. It has street lights and road signs show road names and traffic signals.,Strongly Agree,I identified a crossroad needs to have at least two roads or train track that intersect with each other and that there are road signs and street lights present at every crossroad.,Strongly Agree,I identified a crossroad needs to have at least two roads or train track that intersect with each other and that there are road signs and street lights present at every crossroad. This information can be used for future images.,Crossroads can also have markings on the road itself at the intersection.,,73,Yes,There are four roads crossing over each other. The roads are all connected and there are crossing symbols and stop signs to indicate there are multiple roads in the picture.,No,"There are no roads in this photo, only train tracks. There are a couple of train tracks crossing over each other, but it is not a crossroad.",Yes,There are four roads intersecting each other. They are both paved roads and are slightly wet.,Unsure,"There are street signs indicating that there is a crossroad there, but there is no image of a crossroad.",Yes,There are four roads intersecting each other to make a crossroad. There are also street lights pointing in the direction of the roads to indicate there is a crossroad.,Strongly Agree,I explained how there are street signs that can indicate a crossroad.,Strongly Agree,I explained how roads crossing over each other can make a crossroad.,Too look at stop signs that say 4-way crossing.,,74,Yes,A road comes perpendicular to another road. You have to cross one to turn on to the other. YOu have to cross it to get to the other side,No,There are no roads here. Its all train tracks. Nothing is crossing. its all straight on rails,Yes,Two roads converge and cross one another You have to cross the other road to get to the other side.,No,There are streetsigns but they dont actualy show the roads they represent. There are no roads in the pic at all,Yes,There are streets that cross one another. The roads intersect and thus cross,Agree,I explained how roads cross and what makes them cross,Agree,I explained why other things like trains arent cross roads,none,,75,Yes,There are two roads intersecting. There is a stop sign parallel to another road. A crosswalk that begins on one road is intersecting another road.,No,"There is no focal road in the picture. These are train tracks. There is a train on one of the tracks. These tracks fork, but don't intersect across each other.",Yes,There are two roads intersecting perpendicularly. There are two sets of stop signs that are parallel to the roads across from them. There is a big open space where the roads intersect.,Yes,"There are two street name signs that are perpendicular to each other. There are two ""one way"" signs that are perpendicular to each other. There are two crosswalk signals that are perpendicular to each other. They are all on one pole.",Yes,"There are two roads intersecting perpendicularly. There are two sets of traffic lights, and they are set to different colors. When one is red, the other is green, and vice-versa.",Agree,"I included signs to look for including street names, one way signs, traffic lights, cross walks, and angles.",Disagree,There weren't enough examples that weren't crossroads.,Crossroads that intersect at acute angles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
