There are no people in front of the plates.,No,It is food on the plate but there is not a person using the fork to put the cake into their mouth,Agree,I felt I described the different concepts of what the image was,Agree,I felt I gave enough information to recognize this action in the future,no,65,Yes,"This picture is a great at showing the concept of eating. Multiple humans are placing food that was served on plates, into their mouths. People often gather together to enjoy eating a meal and in the image shown above, they are at a restaurant of sometime. In addition to eating, people often also consume liquid drinks.",Yes,"The animal in the picture is shown consuming the food. This is a great example of eating as the animal is placing the food in its mouth for consumption. If the food were just sitting there without the horse shown, then it would not show the concept of eating. In order to eat something, the item in question is usually placed in the mouth of the animal or person that plans to consume it.",Yes,The two people in the picture are consuming the food that is shown on the plates on their table. This is another great example of eating as the food is being bitten and placed into their mouths for chewing and swallowing. You will also notice other people in the restaurant eating as well. Eating food is often a social event so people often do it together.,Unsure,"The picture above shows a cook in a kitchen preparing food, but it does not show anyone consuming the food itself. In this case I would say that the image does not show the concept of eating as the food is just sitting there and not being touched.",Yes,"You can see that the image has eating within it. A eating utensil and plate is found in the image which indicates that someone intends to consume the food. The food was cut into a portion so that it could be eaten which is also an indication that someone plans to eat this. If it was not being eaten, the cake would probably not be on a plate with a fork and would probably be whole.",Agree,I explained what eating is where and how people do it. I also explained the intention to eat something such as when a plate has a utensil on it.,Agree,I explained where it is appropriate to eat and why an image would be considered eating vs just showing food items. I explained that the concept of eating includes placing food in your mouth. I also explained the concept of people often eating together.,I did not explain the difference between drinking and eating so that may be confusing as it is a similar process and could somewhat confuse the machine. I also did not explain biting so if an image were to show someone being bitten it may be confused for eating.,66,Yes,I checked for a person in the photo. Then I checked for food. Then I checked to see if the people in the photo were putting the food in their mouth or using a utensil to pick up the food.,Unsure,"There is a live animal in the picture. There is also a salt block. The animal (a horse) is licking the block. But its not actually eating the block, since they do not eat salt blocks, just lick them.",Yes,I looked to see if there was people in the picture and if there was any food in the picture. Then I checked to see if they were putting the food in their mouth or picking it up with their hands to eat.,No,I looked to see if there was a person or animal in the picture. Then I looked to see if there was food. Then I looked to see if the person or animal was putting the food in their mouth.,No,"I first checked for a person or animal in the picture (There was none) so even though there is a picture of food and a utensil to eat it with, there is no one to eat the food in this picture, so it is not eating.",Agree,"I think I gave the proper steps for the computer to find out if there is food and a person present, but I am not sure if it can understand that they need to be picking it up or putting it in their mouth.",Agree,"I think by identifying if there is both people/animals in the picture and food, it should be able to guess if they are eating or not.","They need to be picking up the food, or using a utensil, and some things like a horse licking a salt block is not eating.",67,Yes,"The humans above are seen lifting forks in order to eat, so as a human I determine the concept is about to occur.",No,"The mule shown cannot eat the brick being shown. It is only licking it. If an object that can't be digested is being licked, then it is not being eaten.",Yes,"As a human, I determined eating is in the image because a woman on the right is shown putting food in her mouth, which is the action done called ""eating"".",No,Nothing is going into anyone's mouth. The concept being shown is only prepping.,No,"In order for the concept to occur, a human or animal must be in the photo looking prepared to put the food in their mouths.",Agree,"I tried to go through the human process of thinking as well as possible, but worry it might not be good enough.",Agree,I went through my thought process as well as possible to help the computer understand the concepts being shown.,Eating vs licking,68,Yes,I see group of men sitting at a table and eating,No,A horse is licking but there is no food present,Yes,people are putting food into their mouths,No,no one is placing food into their mouths,No,no one is present,Agree,I was concise,Agree,I was accurate,None,69,Yes,"Every person in this picture has food in front of them, they have their utensils out and eating the food.",Yes,"The animal has its mouth down and tongue out on an object, which would signal the animal eating something.",Yes,"the women are sitting in front of plates of food, and have said food in their hands and up to their mouth, which signals eating.",No,"This is a restaurant but no one is eating, not food is visible, to be eating you must have food at your mouth",No,"The picture shows food, that may be in the future will be eaten, but no one is eating the food in the picture, no person is visible in this picture to eat said food.",Neutral,"I tried to explain the concept of eating, I would like to say I did a good job, but I am not really sure.",Agree,future items the computer would be able to catch some things.,I tried to cover everything.,70,Yes,People are putting food into their mouths and chewing. Placing food into the mouth does not have to be a continual exercise and people take time in between bites to chew the food they are eating.,No,"In this image the horse is licking. Licking alone is not considered eating. It is not putting food into the mouth, chewing and swallowing.",Yes,"People are putting food into their mouths and thus eating. Chewing and swallowing food is part of eating, as well as biting.",No,"There is food present, but no one is actually putting food into their mouths. Food alone does not constitute eating.",Unsure,"There is food present along with silverware. This alone does not show someone eating. In order to be eating, one must be putting foot into their mouths.",Agree,I have clearly defined what constituted eating vs. just the presence of food alone.,Agree,"I have taught the computer that in order to be eating, one must place food into their mouths and chew.",There are times when eating that people are not actively placing food into their mouths and can talk in between.,71,Yes,,Yes,"The horse has his tongue out and is above a trough that usually contains food or drink. A mouth (in this case a tongue) that is ""working"" is a good hint--but only a hint--to understand that a person or animal is ""eating.""",Yes,There are two or three people sitting at a food table. We know it is a food table because food is sitting on plates on the table. Two of the people we see are using their hands to manipulate the food. The woman on the right of the photograph has food raised to her mouth and it eating the food. The woman on the left of the photograph is picking some food up off her plate in preparation for eating that food.,No,"There is no human that can be seen in this photograph who can actually be seen eating food. There is one person in this photograph, but she is facing away from the camera so we do not really know what she is doing, although she is probably preparing food because she is in a kitchen.",No,"Robot, what we have here is a plate with a piece of cake, a napkin, and a fork sitting on it. But no one is actually eating the cake yet.",Agree,"Because I sought to provide enough detail about the eating process for a Robot to be able to understand that process. I explained the use of hands and kitchen utensils in the eating process. I explained that food must be brought to the mouth for the action to be considered eating, and I sought to explain to the Robot when eating--in some circumstances--is *not* taking place.",Agree,"For the same reasons given in the text box above, to whit: Because I sought to provide enough detail about the eating process for a Robot to be able to understand that process. I explained the use of hands and kitchen utensils in the eating process. I explained that food must be brought to the mouth for the action to be considered eating, and I sought to explain to the Robot when eating--in some circumstances--is *not* taking place.","Teaching a Robot something like this is a bit like writing a survey (which I have done on a few occasions): you write a survey and then test it, and very often you do not get the ""type"" of answers from that test as you expected to get. That feedback allows the re-composition of the survey so that it returns results which are usable.   I suspect that teaching a Robot is much the same. So, given the instructions I provided the robot, I can't tell what the robot doesn't understand until I have some feedback from the robot, feedback which I have not had. So I can't answer this question with any degree of accuracy.",72,Yes,,Unsure,The donkey in this photo is at a trough that would be used to for feeding donkeys. The object in this photo is not food for donkeys. It is something they can lick but not consume.,Yes,This photo has humans at a table with food on plates. Humans are using forks and plates to eat the food.,No,This photo does not have food. There is a kitchen that is used to prepare food. But it does not have food shown nor is there a way to eat it.,Yes,This photo has a piece of cake and a fork. The fork is used to eat the cake. The cake is food for humans. Humans eat cake.,Agree,"I used four key objects that are needed for eating: Fork, table, plate and food. All four are needed to complete the concept of eating.",Agree,"The computer should be aware of the four key objects needed for the concept of eating. In future images, these objects all have to be present to identify the concept of eating.","The computer needs to understand what the objects are in the image, what is food and what action by human or animal required to identify eating concept.",73,Yes,,Yes,There is a horse licking a block of food. It may take awhile to consume the block but the horse is definitely eating the block.,Yes,There is a woman eating off of a plate in the image. She has the food to her mouth and is chewing the food.,Unsure,There are plates in a kitchen but there doesn't seem to be any food nearby that's ready to eat.,Yes,There is a piece of cake and a fork indicating that someone is about to eat this cake.,Strongly Agree,I felt I gave enough examples of how people eat.,Strongly Agree,I felt that people with food is a good indicator that they are eating.,To watch for food on plates and if people are eating the food from the plate.,74,Yes,,No,No food in the picture. the hourse is just licking at something it might think is food,Yes,People are putting foood into their mouth. They are actively removing food off their plates.,No,There is food preperatioon but no one actively engaged in putting food in their mouth. There are no customers at the counter,No,There is food but no one is touching it. The food is just sitting there on the plate.,Agree,I explained what eating was and how it works,Agree,I explained why just a pic of food didnt represent eating,nothing,75,Yes,,Unsure,"The horse appears to be drinking. Although the action is similar, eating involves food. If water is being consumed from the mouth it is drinking, and not eating. Eating tends to involve chewing. There is no chewing performed when drinking.",Yes,People are at a table with food on plates. Silverware (eating utensils) are present. One person is clearly eating with their hands by bringing solid good to their mouth and biting it to begin chewing.,No,"This is a kitchen where food is made, but there is no food being eaten. There is no food clearly visible, no people sitting, and no chairs.",No,"This is food that would be eaten, but there is no one present to eat it. Food is required for eating, but food is eaten by an organic lifeform.",Neutral,I feel like my descriptions were too vague even when describing everything I felt I could. It would be easier to describe with a motion component.,Strongly Disagree,"The way people eat, the foods they eat, and where they eat are very diverse. This was a very limited set of examples.",Various ways food is eaten. Different types of foods. Bowls. Ways people sit in different cultures. Different types of utensils. Ways people hold food with hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
